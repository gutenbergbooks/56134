<h2 id="Publishers_Note">Publishers’ Note</h2>

<p>Miss Mary C. Morgan, who has been chosen to edit
the volume, “<i>Girls and Athletics</i>” is an all-around
athlete of remarkable ability. As a student at
Friends Central School, Philadelphia, and at Bryn
Mawr College Miss Morgan played on basket ball,
track, water polo, and field hockey teams and participated
in the gymnastic events. At Bryn Mawr
she held the individual cup in 1913 and 1914 for
the highest number of points in the Interclass Track
and Field meet. On the track she shares the world’s
record for women of 12 seconds in the 100-yard
dash and she holds the world’s record of 15-2/5
seconds in the 100-yard hurdle race of eight hurdles
each 2 feet 6 inches high. Both of these records were
made on cinder track with rubber-soled shoes in the
cumbersome bloomer and jumper costume (cumbersome
as compared to the scanty attire of male
track and field athletes). Miss Morgan also shares
the Bryn Mawr College record of 6-1/5 seconds for
the 50-yard dash and holds the college record for
the standing broad jump&mdash;7 feet 9 inches.</p>

<span class="large smcap">By Mary C. Morgan.</span></h2>

<p>In gathering information for this volume a <i>questionaire</i>
was sent to some three hundred schools and colleges.
Replies were received from two hundred and thirty-seven
of these. Of this number only one school went on record
as opposed to athletics for girls and women. All of the
others make provision for athletics or some form of physical
education. Some schools provide little or no supervision,
it is true, but the great majority provide for or
realize the necessity for provision of adequate control
of this form of training.</p>

<p>The impression one receives from scanning the replies
to the <i>questionaire</i> is undoubtedly that general athletics
for girls are becoming more and more popular, and that
development is slowly but surely broadening out to
include eventually almost every form of athletics for almost
every girl.</p>

<p>From the physical standpoint, any exercise under favorable
circumstances is beneficial in that it develops and
brings into play the muscles of the body and stimulates
the whole system. But all forms of athletics should be
carefully supervised, particularly for growing girls. Every
participant should have a thorough physical examination
and if any limitations are placed upon her athletics, the
reasons for such restrictions should be carefully explained.
It is natural that some people are more delicate
than others&mdash;absolutely unfit for some of the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
strenuous games&mdash;but there are always less strenuous
exercises which may be indulged in.</p>

<p>The physical condition being assured, the girl should
be watched so that she does not enter into the sports
or games with too much intensity. It is a common tendency
of the average American girl to throw her whole
soul into the particular matter at hand. If it happens
to be athletics, often her enthusiasm helped out by a
thoroughly admirable spirit and by quite a lot of “grit”&mdash;as
her brothers term it&mdash;keeps her playing when she is
really tired out physically. This is the time where a
coach&mdash;or if there is no coach, friendly advice&mdash;will show
the girl that she is not getting any benefit out of the
exercise, and she is running the risk of injuring herself.</p>

<p>This excess is as wrong in athletics as it is in anything
else. Be temperate.</p>

<p>My advice to every girl is: Know your physical condition;
use common sense and gauge the amount of exercise
you take by your physical condition and stamina.</p>

<p>Athletics as a builder of character <i>are</i> just as important
as a builder of physical strength. <i>Fair play</i> and
<i>good sportsmanship</i> are the two maxims kept constantly
before the eye. A girl who has won the reputation of
being a clean, square player is happy herself and is admired
by all with whom she comes in contact. There is
no higher compliment than to be called a “good sportswoman.”
A girl who can lose and smile, or win and not
exult over her opponent’s defeat, is quite apt to get something
bigger than mere physical development out of her
athletics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>A few girls have asked me, “How can I learn to play
this or that game well?” Athletics are just like almost
every phase of life; it requires practice and experience
before one becomes skilled. If, then, a girl wishes to be
successful it is best to make a thorough study of the
branch of sport she is going to take up and practice,
assimilating each detail carefully. The amount of time
it takes to become proficient depends upon the natural
ability of the person&mdash;some people are much more talented
in athletics than others.</p>

<p>The best advice I can give is to know your game
thoroughly, so that you may play with your head as well
as your body. Practice until you have confidence in
your ability. Do not practice so constantly and continually
that you become “stale.” A little practice taken
regularly is often more beneficial than a lot of practice
which tires you out so that you are unfit for more the
next day. Do a little bit, so that you are not tired,
increasing the practice slowly.</p>

<p>Some people believe in set training rules; others do
not. It is best to be in good physical condition all
the time if it is possible; it stands to reason, however,
that for especial speed and endurance the physical condition
should be nearly perfect. Sleep is a very necessary
factor; therefore, every athlete should have a long
and sound sleep every night. As for diet, there is a
difference of opinion. It seems reasonable that no heavy
food, nor rich food that is indigestible, should be eaten.
In particular, just before a contest, a light meal should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
be eaten with the proper time for digestion allowed before
playing. Some people make the mistake of eating
heavily and then playing immediately afterward. The
most sensible training seems to be, eat the most nourishing
and easily digested food.</p>

<h3>What to Wear</h3>

<p>Dress sensibly. For track and field games, basket
ball and other games that require speed, agility and the
freest play of all muscles, by all means wear bloomers
and a middy blouse. For tennis, golf and the other less
strenuous games, wear shirtwaist or middy blouse and a
skirt wide enough and short enough to give the most play
of the leg muscles. For instance, there is nothing so
ridiculous as to see a girl athlete togged with more regard
for the impression she is making on the male part of the
gallery than for getting the most physical benefit out of
her game. I have great sympathy for every girl who
takes pride in her appearance at all times. I maintain
that it is both possible to present a neat and an agreeable
appearance and at the same time to dress sensibly for the
business at hand. In each of the following chapters on
the various forms of sports I have endeavored to say a
word about dress specifically for that sport, unless it is
evident what costume is suitable. Back of it all I will
repeat this fundamental: Dress sensibly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<h2 id="Field_Hockey">Field Hockey</h2>

<p>Field hockey, next to basket ball, is the most popular
team game played by girls; and it is a comparatively new
game here, as it has been played in America only since
1901. Miss Harriet Ballintine, Director of Physical
Training at Vassar College, in her pamphlet, “The History
of Physical Training at Vassar College,” gives an
account of the beginning of hockey in America: “Until
1901, English field hockey was comparatively unknown
in this country. Before this it had been played by men
at the Springfield Training School, and to some extent at
Mount Holyoke College. Dr. J. H. McCurdy of the
Springfield School in writing of the game says: ‘The men
at Springfield first played the game of field hockey in
1897. Regarding where field hockey was first played in
this country (by girls), the girls at Mount Holyoke College
had begun playing the game, I think, before Miss
Applebee’s arrival in this country. They had been down
to a number of our championship games. Arrangements
had been made for some of our students to coach the
Mount Holyoke girls in hockey, when I found Miss
Applebee was in this country and recommended their
getting her.’”</p>

<p>Many hockey players owe their interest in the game to
Miss Applebee, notable for her inspiring coaching and the
knowledge of hockey that she has imparted to her pupils.</p>

<p>To the devotees of this game, there is no other sport
that quite comes up to it. In a game of hockey there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
a spirit of freedom, of exhilaration, of gladness that comes
from a true love of sport. And it has other advantages&mdash;absence
of roughness, plenty of vigorous exercise in the
open air, and yet not extraordinarily violent. It is a
game that may be played by all types; a game that is
played by a large number on each team.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Game.</span></h3>

<p>Hockey is played on a level field of turf similar to a
football or lacrosse field. There are eleven players
on each team, thus there are twenty-two players on
the field at one time. Each player is equipped with a
stick with a curved head. A cricket ball is used. The
eleven players are divided into groups: forwards, halfbacks,
fullbacks and goal. Each group calls for a different
type of player. The teams line up (according to illustration)
in the center of the field. The forwards are the
attackers, whose duty it is to advance the ball into their
opponents’ territory and score a goal (Rule II). The
halfbacks assist the forwards in attacking and with the
fullbacks and goal keeper defend their own goal.</p>

<p>The umpire blows the whistle and the game begins
with the two center forwards bullying. The ball has
been placed in the middle of center line, the center
forwards stand with one foot on each side of center line
directly opposite each other, right shoulder toward their
own goal. (See Rule for Bully.) After the bully is completed,
the ball hit out, then play commences. The forwards
of the team in possession of the ball rush it down
toward the opponents’ goal and try to shoot a goal while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the opposing defense tries to prevent any score. Each
time the ball is fairly hit over the goal line, one point is
made by team scoring goal. Two halves, length of which
is agreed upon by captains, are played. The team scoring
the greatest number of goals by the end of second half
wins the game.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Team as a Whole.</span></h3>

<p>The main factor in hockey is team play. There may
be one or two players of stellar ability on the team, but
if the team does not play well together it is not well
balanced. It is not an individual but eleven individuals
welded together that form a team. Every girl should
consider&mdash;when playing hockey&mdash;that her stick is her
best friend; therefore it should be chosen carefully and
with due consideration. There are three important qualities
a stick should have: balance, weight and length. The
balance should be even, not in the handle, but more in the
curved head of stick; not too heavy there however. The
weight of the stick should be 21 or 22 ounces for a forward,
23 or 24 for a halfback, 24 or 25 for a fullback or goal
keeper. Never carry a stick that is too heavy. The
stick should be just long enough for a comfortable grip.
It should be neither too long nor too short.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Hold Stick.</span></h3>

<p>The stick should be firmly held in both hands, with
the left hand gripping the handle at the end (top) of
stick with the fingers forward; the right hand grips the
stick directly below the left hand, touching but not overlapping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the left hand. The hands should never be separated
because this tends to make a player stoop over,
thus losing in strength of stroke. At the beginning of the
stroke, the stick should be carried back toward the right
(the right arm must be kept straight to avoid “sticks”&mdash;a
foul, see Rule III) until the left arm is straight;
then the stick should be carried forward, striking ball
squarely. At the finish of the stroke, the right arm
should still be kept straight and the end of stick turned
in (i.e., toward body) and down to avoid making
“sticks” at end of stroke.</p>

<p>While the stick is not in use or while player is running
it should be carried in both hands horizontally at comfortable
height, as long as it is below the shoulder.</p>

<p>Let us consider the forward line. It is made up
of five positions: left wing, left inside, center forward,
right inside, right wing. Players for these positions
should be selected for the following qualifications: ability
to run with average speed; ability to shoot hard, clean
goals; endurance and wind necessary for constant sprints.
It is up to the forwards to keep the ball in the opponents’
territory; for this, there are two ways of advancing the
ball&mdash;passing and dribbling.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Passing.</span></h3>

<p>Passing, since it is less individual and makes for more
team play, should be ranked first. There are short and
long passes. The short are generally quick passes between
a forward and her nearest teammate, that is, between
an inside and center or between an inside and wing. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
long pass is across the center from the left side of the
field to the right, or <i>vice versa</i>. All passes should be
quick, clean and accurate. Here are a few things to
avoid: Don’t pass the ball straight ahead so that it
goes to one of opposing team. <i>Don’t pass behind your
own forward line.</i> Don’t pass to a guarded player. Don’t
wait to pass until you have been attacked, thus hurrying
your pass. Don’t (especially when passing to the wings)
put all your strength in the stroke, sending the hardest
ball you can.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dribbling.</span></h3>

<p>Next to passing comes dribbling. Every forward
should know how to dribble. In dribbling the ball, both
hands should be kept close together at the top of the
stick; the stick is sometimes turned so that the flat side
is forward; the wrist and hands are adjusted to any position
of the stick. Only a few players are skilled enough
to dribble with one hand. The ball should be kept close
to the stick, slightly in advance of the runner. The
most common fault is that the dribbler follows the ball
instead of sending the ball just where she desires.
The player who is a good dribbler keeps the ball under
control, no matter how speedily she is running. If the
ball is sent ahead too far then the dribbler is apt to lose
control, but if it is kept close to the stick and just barely
touched each time it is easier to manage. The dribbler
should remember: never crouch over the ball, but stand
erect; never let the ball get too far ahead; never permit
an opponent to get so close that you cannot pass the
ball to a teammate quickly. <i>Never keep the ball selfishly.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Bully.</span></h3>

<p>The forwards are called on frequently to bully&mdash;the
start and twenty-five-yard bully (see Rule I)&mdash;so the bully
should be practised until each forward is quick and accurate.
There should be an understanding among the
forwards and halfbacks as to which way the ball will be
hit out on the bully so that some one is always ready for
it. The right hand should grip almost three-quarters
way down the stick, the player then must bend over
the stick. The feet are wide apart, planted firmly on the
ground. (See Rule for Bully.) After the three separate
“grounds and sticks” the ball is hit out. It is here that
quickness and skill count. The halfbacks&mdash;one from each
team&mdash;always back up a bully to help their forwards.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shooting Goals.</span></h3>

<p>It is not necessary to say that it is most important for
a forward to shoot goals. She should shoot as often, as
hard and as accurately as she can, and she must follow
her shots in. This is her main duty and no forward is
up to the mark unless she <i>can shoot goals</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Center Forward.</span></h3>

<p>Center forward is the keystone position. Her duties
are to bully off at the center (for start and after each
goal), to keep the forwards in a straight line, to shoot
goals, <i>to distribute passes to the left and right sides evenly</i>.
If a center forward has a clear field it is all right for her
to dribble, but, as a rule, she should play a passing game.
<i>She also has many opportunities to shoot.</i></p>

up along the striking circle, ready to return the hit and convert it into a goal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Right Inside.</span></h3>

<p>The right inside is governed by the same dribbling and
passing rule as the center. She should be particular to receive
the passes of the left wing. Also a lot of the shooting
falls to her. Both insides should play close to the
center if the center has the ball, or close to the wing if
the wing has the ball.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Left Inside.</span></h3>

<p>The left inside is a more difficult position to receive
passes and to shoot from. It is often wiser for a left inside
to allow a ball to go to another forward if she is not in a
good position to receive it. As a rule, the best balls for
her are from the right.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Right Wing.</span></h3>

<p>The wings should be fast players. In particular, the
right wing has a splendid opportunity for dribbling and
passing. It is mainly the duty of the wings to advance
the ball; if, however, the opportunity arises, they should
shoot. The wing should be careful never to send the
ball too far ahead; never to let a ball go outside the side
lines if it is possible to stop it; never dribble farther than
the twenty-five-yard line; always send the ball toward
the center of the field.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Left Wing.</span></h3>

<p>The left wing should be careful to dribble only when
she has a clear field. In receiving a ball, the wing, if
possible, should stand with her left shoulder toward the
goal she is attacking. Three common faults of a left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
wing are: Letting the ball go out of bounds on her side
too often, thus giving the other side a roll-in; getting
into an off-side position; turning on the ball. (See
Rules VII and IX.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Halfbacks.</span></h3>

<p>All of the halfback positions are extremely hard to
play because they require great endurance, a moderate
amount of speed, hard hitting, and a fighting spirit.
The halfbacks are both attackers and defenders. First,
in attacking they feed the forwards by passes to them.
They should follow up the forward line closely and when
the forwards are inside the circle should be ready to
shoot if a chance comes. On the defensive they should
stick to the opposing forwards closely. The fullbacks
and halfbacks should work together on defense.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Center Halfback.</span></h3>

<p>The center halfback backs up the bullies in the center
of the field and she feeds primarily the center and insides.
In defending she guards the opposing center forward and
the insides if they are playing close to the center. The
half should always watch to see which forwards are free.
She should not send the ball to the spot from which it has
just come, as that spot is apt to be guarded, but should
change the direction.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Right Halfback.</span></h3>

<p>The right halfback feeds the right wing and the right
inside. If both of these are carefully guarded, then she
should send ball to center or to the other side of field.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
In defense she guards the left wing or the left inside&mdash;if
the inside is near the wing. She also backs up all the
bullies on her side of the line.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Left Halfback.</span></h3>

<p>The left halfback feeds the left wing and the left inside
unless they are guarded, then she changes the direction
of the ball. The left half should send very careful, well-placed
balls to her wing and inside, balls that slant a
little bit, not straight ahead. As the right wing is apt to
dribble, the left half should be very quick and should be
careful to avoid running in on the left. (Rule VIII.)</p>

<p>The halfbacks should remember: Never to give up;
if your opponent gets away, run after her and stop her;
never hit through the forward line, always hit the ball
to somebody; never run out of position to tackle an
opponent. Each half should stick closely to the girl she is
guarding. Never interfere with the work of the fullback
or the goal keeper.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fullbacks.</span></h3>

<p>The fullbacks are primarily defensive players although
they have opportunities for long shots to the forwards.
The fullbacks and the halfbacks should never mix up,
by guarding the same girl. The fullbacks stay near their
own goal. If the right half is guarding the left wing
and the center half the center forward, then the left inside
remains for the right fullback to guard. When one fullback
is up the field, that is, near the fifty-yard line (she
must never go beyond the fifty-yard line), the other fullback
should be back toward the goal. The players on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
defense should never be bunched in front of the goal, and
in hitting the ball away from the goal, they should hit out
toward the side lines&mdash;never across the center. In a
corner or a bully the fullbacks should guard the goal
closely.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Goal Keeper.</span></h3>

<p>The goal keeper should be very cool&mdash;not get rattled
if a goal is made by the opposing side. It is well for
the goal keeper to watch the eyes of the opposing forward;
often in that way she can tell where the forward is going
to shoot. The goal keeper should never be drawn away
from her goal line. She should stand about a foot in
front, but no farther away. <i>Above all, the goal keeper
should have courage; she should not step back from any
ball, afraid to stop it.</i></p>

<p>Not only should she rely on her stick, but she should
remember that she may kick and stop the ball with her
body. The main object is to keep the ball out of the
goal and get it in less dangerous territory. This often
requires quick, clear thinking on the part of the goal
keeper. The fullbacks should never leave the goal keeper
alone and unprotected; nor should they stand so close
to her, nor so directly in front of her, that they impede
her playing or obstruct her view of the play. <i>The goal
keeper must never lose sight of the ball.</i></p>

<p>There are a few general directions that might be given
for playing. Keep your own position&mdash;don’t run out of
your place to interfere in someone else’s. Use your head&mdash;flighty
playing merely ends in wildness and nothing accomplished.
Save your strength&mdash;do not use it up in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
first mad rushes and terrific hits. It is the consistent,
steady, dependable player who wins the game.</p>

<p>A great deal of time is wasted in the roll-in, that is,
when the ball is put in play after going over the side line.
The team taking the roll-in should have signals, that is,
an understanding as to the line-up. The halfback generally
takes the roll-in unless the point where roll-in occurs
is near the goal line being defended, then the roll-in is
taken by the fullback. The ball should be sent to the
person best prepared to receive it the wing if she is free
or the inside or halfback; sometimes it even may be rolled
back toward the fullback.</p>

<p>The opponents never leave any player unguarded. As
soon as the roll-in is called, it should be taken quickly.</p>

<p>Just as quickness is an advantage in taking the roll-in
so it is in the free hit. The halfback in whose territory
the foul occurred should take the free hit quickly, before
her teammates may be guarded. Every delay means that
the opponents have an opportunity to guard more closely.
In taking the free hit, be careful to hit to an unguarded
player. Make the free hit count.</p>

<p>In the corner play the hit should be carefully taken
by the halfback, or sometimes it is taken by the wing.
The attackers line up around the edge of the striking
circle ready to stop the ball and shoot for the goal; the
defenders are behind the line ready to rush out and get
the ball away from dangerous territory. The player taking
the free hit should be careful that the ball goes within
the circle; that it is hit hard and cleanly&mdash;never send a
ball that hops; that the ball is sent to a particular player,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
preferably the center forward or either of the insides.
It is not often advisable for a wing to stop a ball hit in
from the corner hit.</p>

<p class="caption">DIAGRAM OF FIELD WITH NECESSARY MARKINGS AND SHOWING
THE PROPER LINE-UP OF TEAMS AT START OF GAME.</p></div>

<p>To decide a championship or the winner of a hockey
tournament, it is advisable to play three games, the
winner of two being the winner of the series. If one
team wins the first two games it is unnecessary to play
the third; if there are more than two teams contesting,
it is advisable to have preliminary rounds, the winners
meeting the winners, etc.</p>

<h3>The Field of Play</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Field.</span></h3>

<p>The dimensions of the field are: maximum length, 100
yards; minimum, 85 yards; maximum breadth, 60 yards;
minimum, 55 yards. The field of play is marked by
boundary lines; the end are “goal lines,” and the side,
“side lines.” Flag posts, four feet in height, one yard
outside the field of play, are placed at each of the four
corners and at each end of the twenty-five-yard lines.</p>

<p>There are three lines across the field, i. e., parallel to
the end lines, running from side line to side line&mdash;one in
the center of field, the fifty-yard line; one at each end
of the field, each twenty-five yards from the goal line.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Goals.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>goals</i> are marked by upright posts, equidistant
from the corners of the goal lines, four yards apart, connected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
by a cross-bar seven feet from the ground. The
space between the posts is known as the goal area. The
maximum width of the posts and the cross-bars is two
inches; the maximum depth, three inches. There is a
goal at each end of the field.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Striking Circle.</span></h3>

<p>In front of each goal is a striking circle marked by the
following lines: A line parallel to goal line, fifteen yards
distant from, directly in front of the goal area, four
yards in length. The ends of this line are joined to the
goal line by a quarter circle fifteen yards in diameter
measured from the nearest goal post.</p>

<p>A line parallel to the side line, five yards distant, is
drawn the length of the field. This is called the alley.</p>

<p>It is important that the lines be distinctly marked in
white. If there are nets behind the goal to catch
balls, it aids the umpire in determining if a goal is
scored. Goal posts and bar may be painted white. The
ball is a leather cricket ball painted white.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dress.</span></h3>

<p>Bloomers and jumper are the most comfortable form
of dress. If a skirt is worn it must be at least eight
inches from the ground. Stopping the ball with the
clothing is not good hockey. <i>Light shoes</i> with rubber
soles, fitted for running, should be worn by the forwards
and halves. Heavier shoes are worn by the fullbacks.
The feet of the player ought to be well protected, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
order that she may stop the ball with her feet. All
players should wear <i>shin-guards</i>; the forwards and
halves light ones, the fullbacks heavier. The goal
keeper will find that the shin-guards used in cricket are
not too heavy.</p>

<p><i>If a hat</i> is worn, it should be without pins and must
have a soft brim.</p>

<p>Many players prefer wearing <i>gloves</i> in order to protect
their hands.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Stick.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>stick</i> should be a regulation stick, curved on one
side, flat on the other. No stick must weigh more than
28 ounces.</p>

<p><i>Time.</i>&mdash;The time of halves (usually 35 minutes) with
the intermission should be determined by the captains.</p>

<p><i>Score.</i>&mdash;Each goal made counts one point. Highest
number of goals at end of game wins. There is no other
score except by goals.</p>

<p><i>Officials.</i>&mdash;There is an umpire, who makes all decisions
of goals, fouls and disputes. She is responsible for the
good conduct of the game. There may be an umpire
for each half of the field. Also a scorer, a timekeeper
and two linesmen, who call the ball out of bounds and
give decisions when appealed to.</p>

<p>Each team has eleven players; for each side there is a
<i>captain</i>, who tosses for choice of goal, protests to the umpire,
governs the team on the field. They must notify
the referee of any change of line-up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<h3 id="Field_Hockey_Rules">Field Hockey Rules</h3>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">Rules Governing Bully.</span></h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Bully is the method of putting the ball in
play. A bully is played by two players, one from each
team, who stand squarely opposite each other (each facing
a side line), each with her right side toward her own
goal. The ball is placed between them, each player having
a foot on either side of the ball. Both first touch
the ground on their right side of the ball, then they touch
sticks. This is done alternately for three times, then
either may touch the ball. After the ball is touched by
either or both of the two players bullying it may be
played by anyone.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The game is started at the beginning of the first
and second halves by a bully-off on the center line.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) After each goal is scored the ball is brought back
to center line for bully-off, as in (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The teams line up in a bully on the side nearest
their goal line and never step over the line of the ball,
i. e., an imaginary line, if ball is not on center or twenty-five-yard
line drawn across field. This is known as standing
behind the ball.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) After time-out is called, the ball is put in play
again by bully on the spot where time-out is taken.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) If a foul is called on both teams, a bully is taken on
the spot where the foul occurred.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) If any rules of bully are not observed, bully is
taken over again.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Penalty-Bully.</i>&mdash;A penalty-bully can only occur
when a defender inside the circle deliberately breaks a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
rule, thereby directly preventing a goal from being scored.
The bully is played on the spot where foul occurred by
goal keeper and a chosen player from the other team.
All other players stand beyond the nearest twenty-five-yard
line until the bully is completed. The bully is only
completed when: First, a goal is scored; second, the ball
is sent out of bounds by an attacker&mdash;if sent out by
defender, penalty-bully is repeated; third, the ball is sent
out of striking circle. In either of the first two cases
the ball is put in play by a twenty-five-yard bully in the
center of the nearest twenty-five-yard line. Any foul
(except Rule I, <i>a</i>) by offender counts penalty goal or
one point for opponents; any foul by attacker (except
Rule I, <i>a</i>) the defender is given a free hit. The goal
keeper in a penalty-bully may play only with the stick;
she may not kick or stop ball with hands. If time is
called, bully must first be completed.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Rules for Goal.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To score a goal the ball must have been hit by
or have touched the stick of an attacker within the
striking circle.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The ball must pass entirely over the goal line between
the goal posts and under the cross-bar.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If a ball, after touching the stick of an attacker
within the circle, glances off the stick or person of a
defender, it is a goal.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If a ball hit fairly glances off a goal post across
the goal line, it is a goal.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The umpire must judge fairness of goal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Rules for Sticks.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The stick must never be raised above the shoulder
in any part of the stroke while hitting the ball, nor may
it be carried over shoulder. When this rule is broken
within the striking circle by a defender, the penalty is
a penalty-corner; if deliberately broken, it is a penalty-bully.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The flat side, never the rounded, should be used
in striking the ball.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A player should never catch the curved part of
her stick in that of her opponent’s, thereby hindering her
opponent’s play. This is hooking.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A player should never strike or hit her opponent’s
stick.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A player should never lift her opponent’s stick
from the ground or in any such manner mar her
stroke.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) A player should never trip an opponent with stick.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) No player without a stick may take part in play.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) For any infringement of rules, a free hit to opposing
side where foul occurred is granted, unless referee
deems the foul rough, thus liable to disqualification.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Rules for Free Hit.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When a team is accorded a free hit by an umpire,
through a foul by opponents, the captain of the team
shall designate the player (generally a halfback or fullback)
who is to take the hit, and no other player may be
nearer the player taking the hit than five yards. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
ball must be hit squarely, not scooped. The free hit is
taken again if this rule is not complied with.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The player who has taken the free hit may not
touch the ball again until it has been touched by another
player.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A foul by a defender in the striking circle upon
taking a free hit is punished by a penalty-corner.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If the player misses the ball entirely upon taking
the free hit, she may hit it again.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If there is any infringement of the rule, the free hit
is given to the other side except when the ball is scooped
by the defender inside the circle, when the penalty is a
penalty-corner.</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Rules for Out of Bounds.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the ball is sent over the side lines it shall be
rolled in (by hand) by one of the team opposing the
player who last touched it. In rolling in, the player
taking the roll-in must stand&mdash;feet and stick&mdash;outside
the side line at the point where ball went out. No
player may stand inside the alley (or five-yard line)
next to the side line over which it went out. The ball
must be <i>rolled</i>, not thrown or bounced. It may be
rolled in any direction, provided it touches within the
five-yard space. The player who has taken the roll-in
may not touch the ball until it has been touched by
another player. The other players may step in the alley
as soon as ball touches.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) First, if the ball is sent behind the goal line by an
attacker; second, if a ball is unintentionally sent behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
goal line by a defender more than twenty-five yards
away from her goal line, it is a twenty-five-yard bully.
The ball is placed on the twenty-five-yard line, exactly
opposite the spot where it crossed the goal line.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If a ball is unintentionally hit across the goal line
by a defender or glances off her stick over the goal line,
it is a corner. In a corner, the attackers line up around
the outer edge of the striking circle&mdash;feet and sticks&mdash;behind
the line, with one of their team hitting the ball
to them from the corner of the field (on the side or back
line not more than three yards away from the corner) on
the side of the goal line where ball went out. The
defenders must stand&mdash;feet and sticks&mdash;behind their goal
line at least five yards away from the player taking the
corner hit. The defenders may rush out as soon as the
ball is hit. Before the attackers may hit the ball toward
the goal, the ball must be stopped&mdash;not necessarily dead.
The player taking the corner hit may not hit the ball
again until touched by another. (Penalty, free hit for
opposing side.) If an attacker shoots for goal before
ball has been stopped, it is a free hit for opposite side.
If the player taking the corner hit misses it entirely on
the first stroke, she may hit it again.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If a ball is deliberately hit over goal line by a defender,
it is a penalty-corner. Both teams line up as in
an ordinary corner. The hit is taken, however, from a
point on the goal line at least ten yards from the nearest
goal post and no opposing player may be nearer than five
yards. Ball must be stopped before replayed by attacker
teammate unless it has been touched by defender.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">Rules for Undercutting.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The ball may not be so hit that it is lofted or
raised intentionally above the shoulder.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The ball may be “scooped” so that it may be
raised moderately in air.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Penalty for intentionally lofting is a free hit
for opposing side.</p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">Rules for Offside.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the opponents’ territory, no player may receive a
ball from one of her own team standing farther from the
goal than she, the receiver, unless there are at least three
of her opponents between her and the goal. Violation
of this rule is called offside.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A player is not penalized for offside if she does
not touch the ball; if it was touched last by an opponent;
if one of her own team nearer the opponents’ goal than
she hits the ball; if she is in her own half of the territory.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Penalty for offside is free hit for opposing side.</p>

<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">Running in on the Left.</span></h3>

<p>No player shall run in on the left side of her opponent
in order to gain possession of the ball so that any part of
her person or stick touches any part of the person or
the stick of the opponent. Penalty is free hit for opposing
side.</p>

<h3>IX. <span class="smcap">Turning on the Ball.</span></h3>

<p>No player having possession of the ball shall interpose
her person between the ball and an opponent, nor shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
she turn around the ball in order to obtain a more favorable
position for her stroke. Penalty is free hit.</p>

<h3>X. <span class="smcap">Handling.</span></h3>

<p>The ball may be caught or stopped by the hands, but
must be immediately dropped perpendicularly to the
ground so that no advance is made nor direction changed.
It may not be picked up, carried or thrown. There
shall be no shoving, pushing, or holding. If the ball
stopped by goal keeper rebounds from her hand it is not a
foul. Penalty is free hit.</p>

<h3>XI. <span class="smcap">Kicking.</span></h3>

<p><i>No player may kick the ball</i> except the goal keeper
within her own striking circle. The foot may be used
to stop the ball, but must be withdrawn and not used to
block opponent’s stroke at the ball. Penalty is a free hit.</p>

<h3>XII. <span class="smcap">Rough Play.</span></h3>

<p>There should be no charging (rushing or running into),
shinning, tripping, personal handling, impeding progress,
or hitting with stick. No player may obstruct, i. e.,
prevent opponent from reaching the ball or prevent opponent
from attacking teammate. Penalty is free hit or
disqualification if umpire decides the play is rough.</p>

<h3>XIII. <span class="smcap">Time-out.</span></h3>

<p>Time-out may be called by the umpire at the request
of either captain only in case of injury or accident to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
clothing or stick. Time-out should be called by umpire
in case of loss of ball or dispute in regard to decision.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<h3>XIV. <span class="smcap">Umpire.</span></h3>

<p>The umpire, or umpires, have control of the game, and
are responsible for it. They must see that there is no
rough play, and that the game is played according to
rules. The umpires judge goals, roll-ins, bullies, corners.
They also have the power to punish players for intentionally
delaying the game. The ball is in play until umpire’s
whistle blows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<h2 id="Basket_Ball">Basket Ball</h2>

<p>Basket ball needs no introduction. It is probably the
most popular game played by girls. Through the work
of the Executive Committee on Basket Ball Rules, headed
by Mrs. Senda Berenson Abbott, chairman, the playing
rules and the conditions under which the game may best be
played have been thoroughly studied and set forth in the
Spalding Official Basket Ball Guide for Women, No. 7A.</p>

<p>The game may be played either outdoors or indoors,
depending upon conditions. When the circumstances
permit it is always desirable to play out of doors. The
writer is a firm believer in outdoor exercise wherever and
whenever possible, but there is a decided need for a
wholesome, interesting game for indoors during the long
winter months. Basket ball undoubtedly fills this need.</p>

<p>The game is played by two teams consisting of either
five, six, seven, or nine players each. If the teams play
with five on a side, there are two forwards, a center and
two guards each; if with six on a side, there are two
centers each; if with seven, three centers; if with nine,
three forwards, three centers and three guards.</p>

<p>The court (floor or field) is divided into three equal
parts. The lines dividing the court are parallel to the
end lines. They are known as field lines. The reason
the court is thus divided is to define the space in which
the various players may operate. Thus each set of
players can operate only on their third of the court, so
that the line game makes a minimum physical demand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
upon the player. That is, the forwards of Team A and
the guards of Team B may run only in the third of the
floor before the former’s basket; the centers of both
teams in the space in middle, and the guards of Team A
and the forwards of Team B in the third of the floor
before the latter’s basket.</p>

<p>The three general positions call for three different
kinds of skill. The forwards should possess a good eye,
should have the knack of handling the ball well and
should have agility and speed. The center should have
height, ability to get possession of the ball and the knack
of feeding well, that is, passing the ball to her forwards.
The center rarely shoots for the basket in the line game.
The guards, as their name implies, must prevent the
opposing forwards from shooting a goal, so must be
quick, active and able to jump well.</p>

<p>The game begins with each team in position. The
referee puts the ball in play by tossing it up between the
centers, who jump and bat it (they must not catch it).
When once in play the ball must be passed from one
player to another&mdash;not handled, nor rolled, nor kicked.
Nor may any player carry it, but she may bounce it
once, taking not more than two steps during the bounce.
Thus the game is essentially one of team play, which
calls for fast, clever, clean co-operation in playing. The
play continues until a score is made, or a player fouls,
or the ball goes out of bounds. A score is made when
a player shoots the ball into the basket from the field,
which counts two points for the score of her team. A
foul is made when a player of one side transgresses a rule of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the game&mdash;running with the ball, holding the ball more
than three seconds, touching over the line with some part
of person, guarding too closely, etc. When a player fouls,
a free throw from a mark fifteen feet from and directly in
front of the basket is allowed to a forward of the opposing
side. When the ball passes through the basket, rim
and net, one point is added to the score of the team.</p>

<p>When the ball goes over the boundary lines, the game
is stopped and the ball is given to the nearest opponent
of the girl who touched it last. She then passes the ball
to one of her teammates, thus starting play again.</p>

<p>The winning of the game is determined by the scoring
of the most points (both field goals and free throws) in a
given time&mdash;usually fifteen-minute halves with a ten-minute
intermission. Baskets are exchanged at the end
of the first half.</p>

<p>From my own experience and observation I find the
average player is weak in passing. One of the faults is inaccuracy.
Every pass should count; but if the pass is wild,
thrown <i>at</i> a teammate rather than <i>to</i> one, much strength
and time is wasted. Throw directly to an unguarded
player, or if she signals to send the pass to a certain spot,
send the pass there. Think carefully what results come
from a careless, inaccurate pass. It may end in fumbling,
or the ball out of bounds, or the ball obtained by
opponent, waste of time, delaying the game.</p>

<p>The passing is apt to be slow. Get the ball out of your
hands as quickly as possible. To do this, every player
must know the relative positions of all her teammates.
She must decide the moment the ball touches her hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to whom she is going to pass, then pass quickly and
carefully. By quickly I do not mean hurriedly; I mean
the player should not hold the ball an undue length of
time deciding what to do with it.</p>

<p>Many players have but one way of throwing the ball,
always using the same pass. Vary your passing according
to the need. If a high ball with a drop to it can be
used, use it when your teammate is in a good position to
receive. But do not use this style of pass exclusively.
Try a short, swift pass. If when you are guarded for
one pass, quickly change to another, such as, from an
overhead pass&mdash;both arms holding ball high over head&mdash;to
a low side pass&mdash;the arm held out toward the side,
the palm of hand around the ball, which rests on the
flexed hand and wrist. It takes a great deal of practice
and team work to make the passing perfect, but remember
always be wide awake and alert, ready to receive the ball.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the team work is the main factor.
It is the way the team plays, not the way one player
stars, that counts.</p>

<p>Each of the different players has a different duty to
perform. The forwards have to shoot both field and
foul goals. In shooting baskets, it is of prime importance
to have some chosen point on basket or back board to
aim at. Of course, there are many forwards who shoot
at random; goals are made, but many more are missed.
Once this spot for the aim is made definite&mdash;through
much practice&mdash;the aim becomes surer.</p>

<p>Many a game has been lost through the inability to
shoot foul goals. The feet should toe the 15-foot line,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
slightly apart, fixed firmly on the ground. The ball is
held in both hands, palms flat on opposite sides of the
ball; the lace is turned toward the basket. The knees
are bent; the ball is carried forward and down, arms
straight. Simultaneously the knees are straightened, the
arms are carried forward and up, the ball leaves the
hands. Just as the ball leaves the hands an “English”
is put on it. That is, the ball is twirled as it leaves the
hands. The advantage of the “English” lies in the fact
that it serves to make the ball shoot through the basket
instead of bounding out, as is often the case when it is
tossed up a little off the true and without the spin.</p>

<p>Good passing is necessary for the forwards. The forward
should remember never to shoot unless she is in a
favorable position; one forward should always stick close
to the basket. Always try to keep free; pass to your
opponent whenever possible; never keep the ball selfishly
in order to gain a shot for yourself.</p>

<p>The center should realize the importance of this position.
Naturally the forwards cannot score goals unless
the ball is sent to them. Thus, the center should be
alert and quick, free to receive the pass from the guards
and quick to send a good pass to her forwards, who should
be dodging their guards, trying to get in a favorable position.
Often the center can well make use of the bounce
and step to get away from the opposing center.</p>

<p>The guard has to remember that every time the forward
gets the ball, if she is good, she has a chance to get
it in the basket. Thus, it should be the main object of
the guard to get the ball away from her end of the field.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Every guard should try to get the ball and send it out
of dangerous territory. Then she should stick closely to
her forward, guarding her as closely as the rules allow.</p>

<p>One fault of the guards is over-guarding. This is generally
done through over-anxiety. The guards should
watch carefully so as not to foul.</p>

<p>Jumper or middy blouse, bloomers and rubber-soled
shoes make up the accepted costume.</p>

<p>Above all, the element of good sportsmanship and fair
play should enter into every game, no matter how
strenuous the playing, and the slogan of the whole team
should be, “Put the ball in the basket.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Basket Ball Games or Tournament.</span></h3>

<p>An umpire who is competent and fair should have
entire jurisdiction over the game. The game should be
conducted in an orderly fashion, according to the rules.</p>

<p>For a series or tournament, a set number of games
should be played, such as two out of three; the winner
is then the champion. If more than two teams play,
the winners should play the winners, etc. Let me impress
the importance of set rules agreed to and known
thoroughly by every player; this saves much dispute and
sometimes bitter feeling.</p>

<p>Leagues of basket ball teams, such as are to be found
in some cities, etc., organized for the purpose of clean
sport and good fellowship, have been extremely successful.
Each team may play a set number of games with
every other team, the winner of the most games being the
champion of the league.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<h2 id="Gymnastics">Gymnastics</h2>

<p>Gymnastics, or work in a gymnasium, indoors or out,
is recognized the world over for its utility. The term gymnastics
usually applies to a group or class drilled by an instructor
or coach. Gymnastic exercises may be, however,
adapted to fit an individual, prescribed for her by a
competent authority (which may be herself).</p>

<p>The very great and growing popularity of gymnastic
exercise is due to several facts. First of all, there is a
general awakening to the need for organized exercise at
most schools and colleges and within the ranks of many
social organizations. Aside from walking, gymnastic exercises,
as they have been developed by the Swedes and
the Germans, are possibly the most obvious form of beneficial
physical exercise. Then this form of physical
training has the very decided advantage of being susceptible
to the widest kind of application. It may be graded
so as to be beneficial to various groups of individuals of
varying physical development. It may be given in the
most scientific quantities&mdash;more so than any other form
of exercise save walking. It may be used as a drilling
force to instill discipline&mdash;against fire, for instance&mdash;in
great groups of persons, for ability and sufficient knowledge
in handling one’s body quickly and efficiently in a
crowd under abnormal conditions is quite an important
and necessary accomplishment. In fact, everyone, no
matter at what age, could do well by her or his body to indulge
in some form of calisthenics or gymnastic exercise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>There are two main divisions of gymnastics&mdash;floor work
and apparatus work.</p>

<p>The floor work consists mainly of tactics, calisthenics,
drills with hand apparatus, such as wands, dumb bells,
Indian clubs, etc., dancing and posturing exercises.</p>

<p>The tactics consist mainly of marching by ones, twos,
threes, fours, etc., of flank marching, and of circle marching.
Form in this counts for a great deal together with
quick execution of commands and memory of the proper
method by which the figure is to be executed. Perfect
form in marching consists of the head erect, the eyes
straight ahead, the shoulders back, the arms down
straight at the sides, the palms of the hands turned toward
the body, the fingers close together; the toes should
be pointed and reach for the floor, so that the muscles
of the leg and the thigh can feel the effort made. Also
the marchers should observe carefully the space between
each one and the straightness or regularity of the line.
Watch the person ahead of you and beside you. This
keeps the marching from being ragged.</p>

<p>In the calisthenics and drills&mdash;Indian clubs excepted&mdash;the
most used exercises are: the arm stretching or raising
upward, downward, sideward, forward; the bending of
the head, trunk, arms, or legs; the bending of the knees;
the stretching of the legs; the lunges sideward and forward;
the raising and sinking on the toes. These are
the fundamental exercises and may be combined to form
the different drills. To attain perfect form in these,
it is best to watch a competent gymnast; after so doing
it is possible, by careful imitation, to attain good form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
yourself. These exercises may easily be practised in any
sufficient space, in front of a mirror when possible. It
is well to remember that form and grace are very important
factors. Always keep in mind that the lines of the
body should be kept symmetrical; that a lot of snap in
executing the exercises is a help.</p>

<p>The Indian club drills consist of full arm swings, circles,
dips, etc. These can best be taught by a teacher. Form
is the all-important factor here also.</p>

<p>Dancing is divided into three separate groups: æsthetic,
social, and folk dancing. The æsthetic develops the
natural grace of the body; social dancing does this, too,
but not to such a great extent. There are many girls
who feel ungainly and unnatural in the æsthetic and social
dances. For these are the folk dances. These dances
are a natural expression of joy and good humor. The
girl who is most unsuited to other types of dancing
may enjoy and ultimately become very efficient in folk
dancing.</p>

<p>Posturing may be added here. This is practising and
attaining the correct poise and positions of the body.</p>

<p>Apparatus work consists of exercises on the following:
stall bar, horizontal bar, parallel bar, trapeze, swinging
rings, traveling rings, ropes, rope ladder, horizontal ladder,
side horse, buck, etc.</p>

<p>The secret of success in apparatus work lies in the
knowledge of muscular control and of the balance of the
body. By muscular control, I mean the power to exert
the proper amount of strength at the exact moment;
by balance, I mean adapting the weight of the body to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the strength. Apparatus work should be undertaken
carefully&mdash;if possible, under the supervision of an instructor;
mats should always be placed to break any
fall. Too continued exercises tire even the best gymnast;
sometimes the girl does not realize she is tired.
Between exercises give yourself plenty of rest and relax
your muscles.</p>

<p>As the subject is so extensive and so varied I can only
mention a few exercises. The most popular pieces of
apparatus seem to be the side horse, the parallel bars, and
the swinging rings.</p>

<p><i>The Side Horse.</i>&mdash;The most elementary exercises on
the horse are the rests. The girl grasps the pommels
of the horse and jumps to a straight-arm position; the
body is straight, weight on the arms. Or she may jump
to a kneeling position between the pommels; or she may
jump to her toes. There are different ways of ending
these exercises, either jumping back to the first position
or jumping to the other side of horse. Another exercise
is to run, grasp the pommels with both hands, arms
straight, draw the legs up and shoot them between the
pommels, landing on opposite side of the horse. The landing
may be straight or by retaining a grip with one hand
on the pommel, you can turn either to the left or the
right, according to the hand on pommel.</p>

<p>Next comes the vaults. In vaulting you must remember
always to jump from both feet from the center of
the springboard. The best form in vaulting is gotten
by keeping the arms as straight as possible; the body
should be straight with toes pointing and together, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
legs thrown high in the air. The different kinds of
vaults which may be taken on either side are: The front
vault; the face and front of the body are turned above
the top of the horse, the landing is made facing the side.
The flank or side vault; the side of the body is above the
horse, the landing is made between the pommels with the
back toward the horse. The back vault; the back of body
is over the horse, the landing is the same as the side vault.
The wolf vault; for the right side, the left leg passes
through pommels, the right leg passes over the right
pommel; as the right leg passes over the pommel, the
right hand is taken away so that leg may pass; the hold
is kept by the left hand. Same for left side, except leg
and hand used are the left instead of the right.</p>

<p>Besides the vaults there are cuts, circles, dives, and
inversions, which may be acquired by practice.</p>

<p><i>Parallel Bars.</i>&mdash;As on the horse, the most elementary
are the rest positions. Jumps to straight arm position
at sides or ends accompanied by lifting of arms and legs,
etc. It is important that every gymnast know how to
swing and vault well on the bars. For the swing, the
hands grasp the bars directly opposite each other. You
then jump to a straight-arm position. To start to swing,
the heels are drawn back, the legs brought forward and
upward with free movement from the hips. The head
should be held up, trunk kept erect, legs straight, toes
pointed and together. For the front vault, the front
of body faces the bar; for the back vault, the back of the
body is over the bar.</p>

<p>On both the horse and the parallel bars are a multitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of cuts and circles combined with each other and with
vaults.</p>

<p><i>Flying Rings.</i>&mdash;The proper way to swing on the rings
is to have the rings at such a height so that the arms are
straight and the feet touch the ground comfortably. Then
step backward, grasping the rings, one in each hand, until
the tips of the toes just touch the ground; run forward,
swing the legs forward and upward from the hips. As
the body swings backward, touch the floor with both feet
as if stepping; do the same on the forward swing. The
legs in swinging should be kept straight both forward
and backward, toes together. Another popular exercise
on the rings is the inversion, that is, hanging head down,
feet in air, the body straight.</p>

<p>There are many exercises on these three pieces of apparatus
together with those on the other apparatus, for
which there is not room in this book.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gymnastic Meet or Exhibition.</span></h3>

<p>An interesting event at many gymnasiums is a meet or
exhibition&mdash;in case of school, college, or club, generally
the results of the year’s work. If these events are competitive
or non-competitive, it is, for the most part, the
most carefully practised work by the most proficient girls.</p>

<p>If these events are judged, the judges, as a rule, have a
certain mark, such as 10, for each event. If the performance
of the event is perfect, then the number won
for that event is 10; if nearly perfect, then 9 is given,
etc. The judges consider entrance; general appearance,
such as neatness, regularity of order, etc.; manner of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
executing the exercise, such as form, position, memory,
rhythm, etc.; the finish or exit. All of these factors are
taken into account by the judges in scoring.</p>

<p>Whether for individual or group prizes, it is advisable
to have competent judges who have a decided system of
marking. Usually there are three judges, each marking
the score independently of the others. Comparisons are
made at the end of each event. The scores of all judges
for each performer are added together and divided by
three (or as many times as there are judges) and the
result is the score for the performer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<h2 id="Track_Athletics">Track Athletics</h2>

<p>Everybody knows that a certain amount of exercise is
beneficial to all persons physically able to indulge. But
there are still many protests against more active competitive
exercise. In particular, track and field athletics for
girls and women have been criticised. Of course, it is
only reasonable to admit that for a girl physically unfit,
over-indulgence in track work is a mistake. But in these
days when the majority of schools and colleges have
competent teachers for their athletic work, and when
the girls are allowed to participate in events only after a
thorough medical examination, the danger from track
work seems to be rapidly diminishing.</p>

<p>Tennis, basket ball and battle ball were the first competitive
sports to be widely participated in by the colleges.
Miss Harriet Ballintine, Director of Physical Culture at
Vassar College, thus tells of the beginning of track and
field sports for women in her book, “The History of Physical
Training at Vassar College”: “Following basket and
battle ball a demand was made for other out-of-door activities.
The students became interested in hurdling, running
and jumping, etc. They organized an athletic association
and in November, 1895, the first field day was held.
This was the beginning of track and field sports for
women. Before this time there was no record of girls
taking part in such competitive events. In 1896 at
the Harvard Summer School a course in athletic training
was opened to women. This first class was composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
principally of teachers from schools and colleges whose
students had asked for instruction in athletics. After
Vassar’s first field day many schools and colleges became
interested in such contests. Previous to 1896 a course
in athletics had been offered to women at the Chautauqua
Summer School, but as there was no demand for it,
the Harvard Summer School was, therefore, the first
school to give systematic instruction to girls in track and
field sports. This first class in athletics for women was
in charge of Mr. James Lathrop, for many years athletic
trainer at Harvard and instructor in the Theory and
Practice of Athletics at the Summer School. He ordered
for Miss Eva G. May, then an instructor in the gymnasium
at Vassar, the first pair of spiked running shoes
ever made for a woman. The Vassar College Athletic
Association provided these running shoes for every student
who entered field day.”</p>

<p>One of the main difficulties in track work at the present
time is that there is no set standard for coaches and
participants to use. A very creditable attempt has been
made by Dr. Harry E. Stewart, Physical Director of the
New Haven Normal School of Gymnastics, to collect the
records made by girls and women. (See Spalding’s Athletic
Almanac, published annually.) However, it is not the exceptional
girl who is of the record-breaking ability that
should be considered entirely. Track work should be
first regarded from the point of view of exercise. The
equipment for track work should be supervised carefully.
The clothing worn should be the lightest and the least
harmful to the limbs. Light shirt waist or middy blouse,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
bloomers, spiked or rubber-soled shoes should be adopted.
The track itself should be level and smooth, the jumping
pits soft so that there is no jar, and the throwing events
should have plenty of room.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_048a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="small">One of the hardest faults to overcome in shot putting is to stay within
the circle. The girl in the picture does not get all of the ground in
the circle that she might, nor is her left hand helping her get the
shot “up” with her right.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Track.</span></h3>

<p>The track, if possible, should be a straight 100 yards.
If the work is done inside it is necessary to work on the
circular track or on the floor of the gymnasium. A cinder
track is the most desirable if it can be procured. First the
earth is dug up, then mixed with coarse ashes; the earth
and coarse ashes are then packed down; fine ashes are
mixed on the top layer. The whole track is then wet
thoroughly and rolled until level and smooth. The track
is generally divided into lanes, three feet six inches in
width, and is made wide enough to have four lanes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Distances.</span></h3>

<p>There are a variety of distances from 25 yards to the
100 on the straight track, and the 220 and the 440 on the
circular track. A few coaches still believe that the long
sprints&mdash;220 and 440&mdash;are not injurious, while others
contend that the half-mile is not so harmful. However,
the 50, 75, and 100-yard dashes seem to be most common
at different schools and colleges. According to the records
collected by Mr. Stewart, 12 seconds is the best
time for the 100-yard; 8-3/5 seconds for the 75-yard; 6
seconds for the 50-yard. The other dashes noted by him
are the 25-yard, 3-4/5 seconds; 30-yard, 4-3/5 seconds;
40-yard, 5-1/5 seconds; 60-yard, 8 seconds; 80-yard,
11 seconds. Also the 220-yard, 30-3/5 seconds, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
440 yard, 1 minute and 16 seconds. There is also a short
relay, 300 yards, four girls, each running 75 yards. This
race is very popular at the colleges.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hurdles.</span></h3>

<p>As in the running races so in the hurdles there is
a wide difference of opinion as to length and as to
height of hurdles and number of hurdles. The 100-yard
hurdle race seems very popular, 8 hurdles, varying from
1&frac12;, 2 or 2&frac12; feet in height. There is also the 120-yard,
10 hurdles, 14 inches high; 90-yard, 7 hurdles, 1&frac12; and
2&frac12; feet in height; 80-yard, 6 hurdles, 2&frac12; feet; 65-yard,
6 hurdles, 2&frac12; feet; 60-yard, 4 hurdles, 2&frac12; feet; 60-yard,
3 hurdles, 2&frac12; feet; 50-yard, 4 hurdles, 2 feet; 40-yard,
5 hurdles, 2 feet; 40-yard, 4 hurdles, 1&frac12; feet. There
is a great variety of choice.</p>

<p>The hurdles should be arranged: First hurdle, 15 yards
from start and each hurdle 10 yards apart, allowing
15 yards between last hurdle and finish line.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet reprinted from the American Physical
Education Review, January, 1916, “A Survey of Track

<p>Mr. Stewart also says: “Only the exceptional girl
should pole vault, run the 220-yard race, or put the
12-pound shot. Hurl ball (Sargent), discus (free style),
javelin throw, standing high jump, and many other events
are good, but the above groups seem sufficient and best
adapted to competitive work.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Jumping.</span></h3>

<p>While all jumping may be done in one pit, where
the space is available it is better to have one pit for
the high jumps, one for the running broad, one for
hop, step and jump, another for the pole vault.</p>

<p>The pits should be soft. All pits are made the same
way but differ in size. The earth should be dug up to
a depth of at least a foot and a half. If ground is hard,
pits should be deeper. This soft dug-up earth should be
equally mixed with sand or sawdust or both. Pits should
be kept well raked up and not allowed to become packed.</p>

<p>For the high jump the pit should be wide, at least eight
feet in width and six or seven feet long. For high jumping,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
two adjustable standards and a bamboo or thin cross-bar
are required. These standards are placed six feet
apart, directly opposite each other in a straight line.
The standards are perforated by little round holes into
which the pegs (not more than 3 inches long) are inserted
to hold the cross-bar. There should be a runway or
approach of at least twenty yards. There is <i>no take-off</i>.</p>

<p>For the running broad jump there is a runway&mdash;cinder
track, if possible&mdash;20 to 30 yards in length, 3 feet in width.
A take-off is sunk, marking division between runway and
pit. This is a planed joist, 5 inches wide, sunk into ground
so that top is on a level with runway, and painted white.
The pit should be at least 25 feet long and about 6 feet
wide. This may also be used for standing broad. The pit
for the hop, step and jump is constructed in the same way.</p>

<p>For the pole vault the uprights should be 10 feet apart,
placed opposite each other. There is a runway&mdash;cinder
track, if possible&mdash;about 20 or 25 yards long, 10 feet wide.
Between the two uprights a plank 16 inches deep should be
sunk, 2 inches of which should be above ground level. In
front of plank, in center, a hole 5 or 6 inches deep should
be dug.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Putting the Shot.</span></h3>

<p>The contestant stands in a 7-foot circle and the put or
throw must be made from within the circle. It is a
foul for either foot to touch the ground outside until
the shot has landed. A toe board raised 4 or 5 inches
above the ground and sunk firmly into the earth should
form about one-quarter of the circle. Spalding’s official
8 and 12-pound shots are used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sprinting.</span></h3>

<p>From my own observation, I have seen few girls that
really know how to run. One great trouble is that the
instinct is to run as speedily as possible from the minute
you get on the track. First of all you should learn to run
well in good form. I shall try to give a few hints to
the runner which may be helpful.</p>

<p><i>Head.</i>&mdash;The head should be up, the eyes looking straight
ahead and firmly fixed on the finish line.</p>

<p><i>Shoulders.</i>&mdash;The shoulders should be kept straight up
and back, not allowed to wiggle from side to side.</p>

<p><i>Body.</i>&mdash;The whole trunk from waistline up, however,
should be bent slightly forward.</p>

<p><i>Arms</i>.&mdash;The arms should be held loosely in a bent
position, the forearm at right angles with the upper arm.
The movement of the arms should be controlled; they
should be allowed to swing forward and backward
in accordance with the motion of the rest of the body.
Many runners do not control the swinging of the arms,
letting them flap sideward, downward, thus wasting
energy. Some runners use cork grips for the hands; personally,
I prefer to run with my hands clenched into a fist.</p>

<p><i>Legs.</i>&mdash;Many runners make the mistake in thinking
the longer your stride, the better your form and the
faster you run. If you have a long stride it is often apt
to be very helpful, but the runner should not try to take
an abnormally long stride. By that I mean take only
as long a stride as you can manage without strain, or
without appearing to be running in leaps and bounds.
Neither should the knees be dashed high in front.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p><i>Feet.</i>&mdash;A great deal in running depends upon the way
the feet are placed. The toe of the foot should reach
out for the ground; the toe should be pointed straight
ahead and each foot should be put down on the ground
directly in front of its former position. The runner
should take care not to run heavily, and she should,
whether in practice or competition, always stride well
up on her toes.</p>

<p>In running you should always think of yourself as
a unit, running with the smoothest possible action.
Some runners are not units, but arms, legs, body and
knees, all wobbling in different ways, giving the general
appearance of falling apart. Yet you must not go too
far the other way, that is, don’t run tensely. Be limber
but not loose. Try to get all the spring and lightness
possible. To do this get the balance over the feet; don’t
run with balance too far forward or too far back.</p>

<p><i>The Start.</i>&mdash;The crouch start is conceded to be the
best. This should be practised until the runner learns to
get away at the word “go,” to get the proper push with
the rear leg, and to rise to an upright position gradually.
There are three counts for the crouching start: “Get
ready.” The fingers are placed just behind starting line;
the arms should be carried straight down from the
shoulders, thus making the hands shoulder width apart;
the runners then kneel on one knee, either right or left,
according to preference; the toe of the forward foot
should be as close to starting line as is comfortable for
runner; the knee of rear leg should be on a line with
front leg, close up to it, with lower part of leg (that is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
below the knee) reaching back as far as possible in a
straight line from the knee. A hole should be dug for
the toe of each foot. “Get set.” The rear knee is
raised, the whole body tense ready for the spring; the
weight is thrown over the front knee so that the toe of
front foot feels the weight and can get a good push over;
the head is up; the whole strength of the body seems
concentrated in the muscles used in springing forward.
“Go” (or the pistol shot). The sprinter springs forward
with all the force possible from the front foot. But she
should not assume an upright position at once, but
gradually, after three or four strides have been taken.
In other starts you stand upright with one leg back, other
leg front. Front leg is slightly bent, weight of body is
over front leg.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hurdling.</span></h3>

<p>In hurdling, the crouching start is very important.
All the form of sprinting should be considered and
also there should be perfect form over the hurdles.
A girl may be a fast runner, but if she cannot take the
hurdles well and quickly she will be defeated by a
slower girl who can. Many hurdlers twist toward the
side, or, in landing, land too far to one side of hurdle.
First the approach from the start to the first hurdle
should be carefully measured by strides. The runner
should always take just this number of strides. The
strides between each hurdle should be counted also.
Then a mark should be made in front of each hurdle,
from which point the hurdler should always rise to the
hurdles. The long low stride is the best over the hurdles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
There are two forms of hurdling, that of the leg bent sideways,
usually recommended for girls, and the “straight-leg.”
For the first, the front leg&mdash;leg first over the hurdle
in the stride&mdash;is bent across the other leg; the arms are
stretched out toward the side; the rear leg is trailed over
the hurdle; the front foot reaches the ground first, the
hurdler landing squarely on the ball of the foot, the toe
pointed straight ahead. Personally, I prefer the “straight-leg”
hurdle to the “side-leg” style. In the latter the
rise over the hurdle is greater, the upright position of the
trunk meets more resistance from the air, the landing
is made with more of a jar. In the “straight-leg”
the stride over hurdle is long and as low as possible;
the body is bent as far over the front leg as possible;
the front leg shoots over the hurdle straight, for as
great a distance as possible, the arm (on same side
of body) is forward when leg is; the rear leg is trailed,
extending slightly to the side from the thigh to the
toe; the weight of body is as far forward as possible,
thus enabling a longer stride; the front foot should
land on ground, on the ball, toe pointed forward; the
rear foot should be ready to shoot out for next stride.
My advice is for hurdlers to practice until they are sure of
themselves before running in a race. They must not hesitate
before hurdles, thus forced to jump off both feet. The
rise should be with the least possible effort; the landing
should be light, the runner immediately resuming the
stride. Never be afraid of a hurdle. Practice until you
are perfect and sure of yourself, and sure of the hurdle.
Confidence makes you successful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Running Broad Jump.</span></h3>

<p>There are two important parts to the running broad
jump&mdash;the run and the jump. The run should not be
so long as to tire the jumper. The first few strides are
slow, then at a mark placed by the jumper the speed
increases until the take-off is reached. The momentum
gathered in this run aids in the jump greatly, thus it is
important that a mark be made the proper number of
strides away from the take-off. The foot which takes
the jump from the take-off should always be the same
one, therefore the strides before the take-off should be
carefully observed.</p>

<p>A spring is made when the foot lands on the take-off.
It is a foul to step over the take-off. After the jumper
has given the best leap possible from the ball of the foot
on the take-off, she tries to augment this leap by drawing
her legs up under her, throwing her arms up and forward.
When nearing ground the feet should shoot forward, the
whole body thrown so that the balance is forward. This
insures a better landing. The jump should be high. Many
coaches teach the girls to jump over a bar, thus forming
a habit of getting height. It is always well to fix your eye
on a point about four feet high and beyond the distance
you can jump. Fix your eye on this at the beginning of
the run and keep it there until a landing is made.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Standing Broad Jump.</span></h3>

<p>The jumper stands with both feet on the take-off, toes
overlapping the outer edge to get a grip. Many
jumpers like to rock back and forth on the toes, knees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
slightly bent; the arms also are swung gently backward
and forward. When the jumper is ready to spring, the
arms should be held above the head and brought back
with a snap as the spring is made, with the knees bent
forward and all the strength concentrated for the jump.
As in the running broad, the jump should be high, thus
the eyes should be fixed on a spot high and beyond the
distance you expect to jump. While in the air, shoot
the arms, legs and body as far forward as possible in
order to gain distance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Running Hop, Step and Jump.</span></h3>

<p>The run is the same as in the running broad jump, except
at the end instead of jumping you first take a hop,
immediately followed by a step and then a jump. The
hop ends on the same foot which landed on the take-off;
then the step, the opposite foot landing on the ground;
then the jump is taken from the foot then on the ground.
The greatest effort should be in the jump; the other two
should not take such a lot of effort that the speed is
slowed up.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Running High Jump.</span></h3>

<p>As in the running broad jump, the girl should have
a mark by which she can tell the point where her speed
should be increased. The same foot should always be
brought to the same position for jumping; thus, the
number of strides should be carefully taken from the
mark to the bar every time. Some jumpers approach
from the left, some from the right. The spring is taken
from the ball of the foot nearest to the bar at a distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
determined by practice, usually three to four feet.
The nearer leg is thrown over the bar. As the nearer leg is
thrown high, the far leg with a strong push leaves the
ground; thus, as the near leg is coming down the far leg
is going up and over the bar. It is often advisable to
throw the body away from the bar.</p>

<p>It is bad form to touch or knock the cross-bar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Standing High Jump.</span></h3>

<p>The form of the standing high is the same, except that
the jumper stands about a foot away from the bar, side
turned toward it. As in the broad jump, she may gather
speed by swinging the arms and rocking on the toes until
strength is summoned for the spring. The feet must not
leave the ground until the spring is made.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pole Vault.</span></h3>

<p>As in the jumps, the pole vaulter must determine
her run to the point where the foot makes the spring.
She should run slowly until the point for the faster
run is marked, then she should gather speed and come
to the spot from which spring is taken. The spring
should always be taken from the same foot, and the
run should always start with this foot.</p>

<p>The pole should be grasped with both hands, the
palm of the lower hand facing inward and the top hand
outward. The vaulter should grasp the pole at the height
of the cross-bar, which she measures on pole at each
increase of height and at each trial.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>During the run the pole is held across the body, with
the hands gripping the pole at proper spot; then the pole
is placed in the hole in front of cross-bar and a spring is
taken from the foot; the arm underneath should be
straight, the one above bent; as the pole swings to a
vertical position the body swings up, and if the vaulter
is strong enough in the arms she should slide the lower
hand up to the top one; an extra push is given to propel
the body over the bar as the pole is released. While
crossing the bar the body should be arched; in falling,
the face should be downward. The landing should be
easy and light.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shot Put.</span></h3>

<p>The competitor must stay within the circle and must
not step over the toe board. If the shot is held in
the right hand, the left side of the body is turned in the
direction shot is going; the weight is on the right
foot, the left foot and left arm are raised to help the balance
of the body; the shot is carried in right hand, which
is held up slightly above the shoulder, elbow of right
arm bent and well back, and held as close as possible
to the ribs. A quick hop forward is taken, the same
position is retained; then the body is turned, the
weight transferred to the left leg, and as this is done
the shot is thrust forward, with the weight and entire
strength of body behind the throw; the right foot comes
forward to preserve the balance; the toe should be against
the springboard.</p>

<p>It is important to learn the correct form in shot putting,
thus it is advisable to practice with a light weight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Basket Ball Throw</span>.</h3>

<p>This throw is similar to the shot put in form, the ball
being held high over the body. It is a foul to step outside
the circle, 6 feet in diameter. The ball also may be
thrown from the flexed wrist position, that is, the ball
rests in palm of hand and on the bent wrist. In both
the throws the ball is thrown after a spring on the right
foot is taken. It is better to throw the ball high.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Base Ball Throw</span>.</h3>

<p>As in the basket ball throw, the base ball throw should
have height. The throw must be an overhand throw
and the competitor must not step out of the circle. The
ball is grasped by some people by the first two fingers
and the thumb, the other two fingers are bent into the
palm.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hurl Ball Throw</span>.</h3>

<p>The regulation hurl ball has a short strap on it. This
strap is grasped in one hand; the side of body is turned
in direction the ball is going; the ball is carried high
overhead and then down, describing a circle; a hop forward
is taken, the ball released as it is starting up&mdash;this
then insures height.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Javelin Throw</span>.</h3>

<p>The javelin is grasped by one hand or by both hands.
The center of balance is found on the javelin; here it is
gripped by the hand, the first and second fingers and
thumb holding it; the hand should be over the shoulder;
a short run should be taken; then, with right foot back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and all the weight on it, the javelin is carried back;
then the arm, shoulder, and body come quickly forward,
the hand releases the javelin and the weight is on
the left (forward) foot. The competitor may not cross
the board or the mark.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Discus Throw.</span></h3>

<p>The discus is thrown in two ways:</p>

<p>1. Free Style.&mdash;The discus is held in the palm of the
right hand, the edge resting between the first and second
joints of the fingers. The flight is guided by means of the
index finger. The right hand is swung down and across
the body; the right foot is at the rear of circle, the left a
little forward; when the right hand has been swung back
to the maximum reach of the arm, the thrower should
pivot on the left heel, then she should crouch, straighten
body and throw the discus, making a spring so that the
feet are changed; thus, right foot is back, left forward.</p>

<p>2. Greek Style.&mdash;This is generally from a block or pedestal;
the competitor, right leg forward, holds the discus
in both hands overhead, then the discus is shifted to the
right hand, which is brought down and back as far as
possible. The knees are bent. Now the knees are
straightened, a jump forward is taken and discus is
hurled in the air.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The main difficulty with track athletics is that they are
overdone, that is, a girl does not consider her strength.
In training a horse, the trainer does not urge it to tear
over the course two or three times at full speed. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
just the way some girls think they are improving their
running or jumping, getting to the top form sometimes
two or three times a day.</p>

<p>It is advisable to practice for form slowly at first, then
increase your effort. In this way then your maximum
effort can be made when you are perfect in form and
condition; not too jaded by overwork to do your best
or so used to hurried efforts that your form is neglected.</p>

<p>One of the great troubles with girls in athletics is that
they pitch in too strenuously, with too much enthusiasm.
This exuberance should be carefully diverted into the
proper channels by the coach. Confine yourself to a few
events, all of which you can do well. It is a useless waste
of energy to spend your strength in events for which you
are too tired to perfect your form. Not only do you
owe to your coach and your school or college the responsibility
for your good health, but to yourself. Therefore
never over-exert in track work.</p>

<p>A coach plays a very great part in track athletics and
should watch closely over the girls. If any of them seem
tired or stale, let them rest for three or four days. Don’t,
in your desire and enthusiasm, forget that more harm may
be done through overwork and too strict training than
in more obvious ways.

<h2 id="How_to_Conduct_a_Track_Meet">How to Conduct a Track Meet</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Competitors.</span></h3>

<p>Every athlete should be entered in the meet a sufficient
time before in order that the places, events and handicaps
may be arranged. Handicaps may be granted if a
mediocre runner is running with one of stellar ability.
Every athlete should have a number.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Officials.</span></h3>

<p><i>Referee.</i>&mdash;The referee has entire charge of the meet
and is responsible for the good conduct of the meet.
All fouls are dealt with by her. She may disqualify
an offender and give the runner fouled another trial, or
allow a new race to be run.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk of the Course.</i>&mdash;This position deals mainly
with the executive part of the meet. The clerk of the
course sees that the events are run in order and on scheduled
time. She sees that the contestants are called on
time for their events. She also assigns the contestants to
their places&mdash;1st, 2nd, 3rd lane, etc.&mdash;for the races.</p>

<p><i>Starter.</i>&mdash;The starter gives the signal. As a rule, the
pistol is the signal for the start. The starter should
have a blank cartridge pistol, which she fires up into
the air. The signals are: (1) “On your mark!” (2) “Get
set!” (3) “Pistol.” The starter may penalize for a false
start or for beating the pistol, that is, anticipating the
pistol shot. She may disqualify if a runner deliberately
starts ahead of the mark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p><i>Inspectors.</i>&mdash;These officials watch for fouls in a race,
such as, impeding a runner; coaching during the race;
crossing into another lane; grasping tape in hands;
knocking over a hurdle.</p>

<p><i>Judges at Finish.</i>&mdash;These judge the order of the runners
at finish line&mdash;1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.</p>

<p><i>Timekeeper.</i>&mdash;The timekeeper must use a stopwatch
and must stand at the finish line. As soon as a runner
touches tape or crosses line the timekeeper stops her
watch, which was started at pistol shot. There should
be at least one timekeeper for each of the first three
runners.</p>

<p><i>Field Judges.</i>&mdash;These judges have entire charge of
field events.</p>

<p><i>Scorer.</i>&mdash;Scorer keeps the official places and times of
the participants.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Races.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Start.</i>&mdash;First false start is penalized a yard; second,
a yard more; third, disqualifies. Any foul during race
or start disqualifies. A tape or strand of worsted is
stretched (about four feet high) across the track; the
winner must breast this tape, arms raised. Every other
runner must cross the finish line.</p>

<p>In a hurdle race the hurdles are placed 15 yards from
start and 15 yards from finish line, allowing 10 yards
in between each hurdle. The hurdler may knock down
or over two hurdles and still win, but she is disqualified
for the third. No record stands if a hurdle has been
knocked over. All other rules for racing hold.</p>

<p>In the relay race the first girl to run starts at pistol;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
she or each succeeding runner must touch the hand of
or hand the baton to the following runner. The last
girl running must cross the finish line. No runner may
run twice in a relay. All other rules for races are the
same.</p>

<p><i>Jumping.</i>&mdash;Each competitor may have three trials, but
she may take but one or two of those if she prefers.</p>

<p><i>Running Broad Jump.</i>&mdash;It is a foul to touch the ground
with the foot on the farther side of the take-off. This
counts as one trial. It is a foul to balk, that is, to run over
the take-off without jumping. The longest jump is
scored. The distance is measured by a field judge from
the take-off to the nearest mark left by jumper.</p>

<p><i>Standing Broad Jump.</i>&mdash;It is a foul to take a preliminary
spring or jump or to touch the earth in front of take-off
with the foot. Measurement same as running broad
jump.</p>

<p><i>Running Hop, Step, and Jump.</i>&mdash;Fouls and measurements
same as running broad.</p>

<p><i>Running High Jump.</i>&mdash;Each competitor has three trials
for each height. Unless she clears the bar without knocking
it off it is a failure. It is counted a trial if the runner
balks and does not jump. It is counted a trial to grasp the
cross-bar. The bar is fixed at different heights; it is also
well to measure bar in middle to determine exact height.</p>

<p><i>Standing High Jump.</i>&mdash;No preliminary jump or spring
may be made. Measurement is the same as in running
high jump.</p>

<p><i>Pole Vault.</i>&mdash;Each has three trials for each height.
A vaulter is allowed to balk&mdash;that is, run without vaulting&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
two balks count as a try. If the cross-bar is
knocked off it is a failure.</p>

<p><i>Weight Throwing.</i>&mdash;Each has three trials. The distance
is measured from the toe board to the nearest
mark left by shot. It is a foul to touch with any part
of person over the toe board or out of circle. It is a foul
to throw the shot instead of putting it straight out from
the shoulder. It counts as a try to drop the shot.</p>

<p><i>Base Ball Throw.</i>&mdash;Same as shot put.</p>

<p><i>Basket Ball Throw.</i>&mdash;Same as shot put.</p>

<p><i>Javelin Throw.</i>&mdash;Same as shot put.</p>

<p><i>Discus Throw.</i>&mdash;Same as shot put.</p>

<p><i>Score.</i>&mdash;The score for first place is generally 5 points;
second place, 3 points; third, 1 point. If there is a tie
the competitors divide the points. If tied for first place,
the sum of first and second points is divided; same for
tie for second place.

<h2 id="Field_Day">Field Day</h2>

<p>Field Day is essentially one on which field sports are
participated in. It is usually held annually. By field
sports are meant the throws, the weight and jumping
events described in the chapter on Track Athletics.
Field Day, however, has various interpretations; it may
be for celebration, or for exhibitions, or for competition.
As the title indicates, Field Day is an out-of-door
function.</p>

<p>If it is a gala day for celebration, there may be different
kinds of dances&mdash;interpretative dances, æsthetic dances,
May pole dancing, and folk dances; there may be drills
of various kinds, such as are mentioned in the chapter on
Gymnastics; there may be tournament meets or games.</p>

<p>Field Day as an exhibition may consist of different
dances, drills and sports, or games that have been practised
during the year and that are displayed now in order
to show the results obtained.</p>

<p>The Field Day in which dancing and drills play an
important part is often enlivened by the use of colors.
Scarfs, streamers or bands of striking colors lend an
effective note to a dance. For the drills a uniform costume
with a distinguishing streak of color is the most
suitable. As modern people like to be entertained, mock
games, “stunts,” and such races as three-legged, sack, and
potato, may be used. The object of the “mock games”
and “stunts” is to amuse as much as possible. There is
very little element of sport that enters in. In the games,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
players used to certain positions may play entirely different
ones; or they may be dressed up in popular “take-offs”
(imitations).</p>

<p>The third interpretation of Field Day is one for the
purpose of holding competitive sports or games. In
fact, Field Day is often held annually to decide the winners
or the champions in the sports indulged in during
the year; or Field Day is the day of the annual track and
field meet. A method for competition in each sport is
suggested at the end of each respective chapter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<h2 id="Walking">Walking</h2>

<p>There is a vast amount of difference between a real
walk and a so-called walk. A saunter along the city
streets in high-heeled pumps and clothing too restricted
to allow a free stride and room for deep breathing is
not a real walk, especially as it usually consists of stops,
such as gazing at shop windows or sampling the confections
of the various stores. A real walk is entirely different,
with the walker reaping all the benefits derivable
from fresh air and muscular activity. There are two
kinds of real walking&mdash;non-competitive and competitive.</p>

<p>To deal first with non-competitive walking, which is
for the sheer joy of exercise and fresh air, there are three
maxims to be remembered by the walker, namely, distance,
form and clothing.</p>

<p><i>Distance.</i>&mdash;The walker should have an objective point,
but the distance should never be longer than can be
accomplished without extreme effort. It never pays to
over-exert. When tired, the walker should rest or stop,
but never give up when the tired feeling is merely imaginary.
Cover up well when resting or upon stopping.
The main trouble often is that an unaccustomed walker
will try to keep pace with a walker of long experience.
The unaccustomed walker is then apt to walk too fast,
too far or too long. Be conservative in the distance at
first, then increase it as your experience increases.</p>

<p><i>Form.</i>&mdash;Many walkers fail to derive entire benefit from
their exercise because they walk badly. The head should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
be up, shoulders erect, chest forward, so that there is plenty
of room for deep breathing. How many walkers fail to
breathe deeply and gloriously! How many walkers gasp
for breath and puff and plod along the way! Then the
arms often are allowed to swing too violently, thus wasting
a lot of energy. Watch your arms; don’t let them
imitate pump handles. Let them move freely but gently.
The legs, of course, are kept straight; the foot should be
put down so that the toe and ball of foot are on the
ground a fraction of a second before the heel. Be careful
that you don’t come thundering down on your heels or
come down with the whole foot flat.</p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>&mdash;The importance of clothing is often disregarded,
for the most part through thoughtlessness. The
shoes worn should be comfortable&mdash;low-heeled, broad toes,
a medium rubber or leather sole. The skirt should be
short enough and wide enough to allow perfect freedom
of stride. The clothing around the body should be loose
enough to allow free play of the muscles and ample chest
expansion. Dress warmly, but do not start with so much
clothing that you will soon become overheated.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tramps or Hikes.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most enjoyable forms of walking is a
weekly series of tramps or hikes. This is an extremely
beneficial form of outdoor exercise for a school or a
club to indulge in. Everybody can join in. A leader
should be appointed or elected and a committee chosen
to arrange a schedule of tramps. Start out with an
objective point of local or historical interest that will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
make a walk of not more than four or five miles for the
first attempt. The distance can be gradually increased
as the walkers become accustomed until finally they can
take all day trips. Such a day spent by a jolly group of
girls gives not only valuable physical development but
also combines exercise with social enjoyment.</p>

<p>Good advice to the walker is: Breathe deeply; walk
briskly; take a walk as often and as regularly as possible
although it may be but a short one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Competitive Walking.</span></h3>

<p>Competitive walking may be for distance&mdash;greatest
distance in a set time; or for time&mdash;fastest time for a set
distance. As in all competitive sports, competitive walking
should be watched for over-exertion, nerve strain and
exhaustion. In the walk the arms are bent; one foot
must be on the ground when other is off or the official
will call a foul for running. The form is called the
“heel and toe” walk, the heel of one foot leaving the
ground as the toe of other foot comes down.</p>

<p>The rules for walking are very similar to those of
running or sprinting. The competitor must start from
behind a starting line, at a given signal, usually a gun.
The distance of the race is measured and there is either
a tape to be breasted or a finish line on the track to be
crossed. False starts are penalized as in track (Page 65).
Two fouls making the offender liable to disqualification
are: running, i. e., having both feet off the ground at
the same time; interfering with or impeding another
competitor.</p>

<h2 id="Golf">Golf</h2>

<p>Golf, like tennis, is a favorite outdoor game. It is
essentially an open weather game, but it may be played
all the year around. It is deservedly popular because it
combines cross-country walking, with all of its many
benefits, and a peculiar skill with a variety of implements
or clubs.</p>

<p>Anybody&mdash;woman, girl or child in her teens&mdash;who has
perseverance can make a golfer. No great strength is
necessary. The only requisites are a good eye, persistence,
a good teacher and the facilities of a course.
Fortunate is the person who at an early age learned his
or her golf from a competent instructor, and fortunate
is the person who has the facilities of a golf course either
public or private.</p>

<p>The standard golf course is of eighteen holes. The
average hole is 300 yards or more, although the distances
usually vary from 125 yards to 600 yards and of a total
length of upward of 6,000 yards. Should a player play
straight over the course it will be seen that a single round
would usually require a walk of four miles. Play is started
from a driving green&mdash;a leveled mound of earth. The ball
is teed-up on the driving green by placing a pinch of
fine sand on the green and the ball upon it so that it is a
half inch or more above the surface. The driver, a
wooden club with a heavy head or sole, is used and the
ball sent with a full stroke as far on its way to the hole
as possible. Usually the space immediately in front of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the tee for 50 or 75 yards is rough ground, terminating
with a bunker and sand pit or some other form of hazard
such as a brook, etc. Then comes the fair green, a more or
less level grassy stretch extending to within a few yards
of the putting green, which contains the hole or cup.
On either side of the fair green is the rough, which is
long grass, sand, water and other hazards. Usually the
putting green is surrounded by traps such as sand pits,
bunkers or mounds of earth and water hazards, while
often a brook trickles through the fair green. The
object of the game is to negotiate the course in the
fewest number of strokes.</p>

<p>The drive from the tee should carry one over the first
rough and over the first bunker or trap and well on to
the fair green. On the fair green, if the hole is a long
one and the lie of the ball favorable, the club used to send
the ball again on its way is the brassie, which is a wooden
club quite similar to the driver. It has a wooden head or
sole, but the bottom of the head is plaited with a strip
of brass to protect the wood, as the ball must be picked
up off the ground without the aid of teeing. The drive
for a girl should net a hundred yards, more or less, and the
brassie stroke about the same. Often the lie of the ball
on the fair green is not favorable to a brassie stroke, in
which case an iron club with a pitch to the head of the
club with which to loft the ball is used. This may be
the mid-iron, the cleek, the mashie-niblic, or the mashie.
The last named club is sometimes called the lofter and is
used mainly for approaching the hole from off the green
from distances of a hundred yards or less. The putting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
green is a very well levelled surface of extremely fine
grass in which the cap is sunk. Putting greens vary from
very fine levels likened to billiard tables to undulating
slopes. The club to use on this green is the putter.</p>

<p>When a player is unfortunate enough to send the ball
into the rough or long grass, a heavy iron club such as
the mashie-niblic or mid-iron is used. And when the ball
is sent into the sand or in a bunker the niblic is played.
This club has a very heavy sole with a decided pitch for
lofting and sends the ball high into the air out of trouble
and on to the fair green when the stroke is played properly.</p>

<p>In learning to putt, the game of Clock Golf, found on
most good courses, is a great help for it means that a girl
may get diversion while <i>grasping</i> the fundamentals. The
first question in putting, as with every club, is <i>to establish
the most efficient grip</i>. There are two classes of grips&mdash;the
overlapping grip and the regular or two-handed grip.
The <i>former is the more modern grip and is, I believe, the
more efficient</i>. The left hand is placed nearly at the end
of the club. The right hand is so placed that the little
finger of the right overlaps the first finger of the left,
and the left thumb is almost entirely covered by the right
hand. This grip brings the wrists closer together than
the two-handed method and so produces greater harmony
of action in the swing.</p>

<p>With the grip established, the next fundamental is the
stance and address. Draw an imaginary line from the
ball to the hole; stand behind the line with heels together&mdash;feet
at right angles to each other, the left foot
pointing toward the hole; the player stands bending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
slightly from the hips with arms stretched down full
length; the right elbow points to the right thigh; the
left points toward the hole; the club swings as a pendulum;
the sole of the club addresses the ball at right angles
to the imaginary line. The player’s eye should be right
above the ball. The secret of the putt is two-fold&mdash;the
swing, which should be in direct proportion to the distance
(and state of the green) from the hole, and the impact
of club and ball at a perfect right angle. The follow
through should be along the imaginary line still preserving
the right angle. With the fundamentals established,
practice will develop astonishingly accurate putting.</p>

<p>When the beginner has become adept at putting, the
next step is to place the ball back on to the fairway
twenty yards or so and take up the mashie. Here again
the fundamentals are important. The grip is already
mastered. The stance however differs in that the heels
are not together&mdash;the feet being farther apart, the right
foot farther behind the ball. The stance and address
are important and the player should obtain the advice of
a professional or seasoned player. The best advice the
writer can give is to study the club and let it do its work.
The mashie can be used for a chip stroke for short distance
and for a full stroke when the ball lies farther from the
hole. It is an extremely important club and when mastered
can save the player many strokes.</p>

<p>The next club to study is the brassie. The stroke with
the brassie is the same as with the driver on the tee. The
stance and address for the drive and the brassie shot
finds the player with feet well apart, the right foot well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
behind the ball, the arms extended, the body upright
and flexible, the weight evenly on both feet and the head
down with the eye somewhat behind the ball. The club
addresses the ball at right angles. In the upward swing
of the club the forearms are turned and the left knee
shifts so as to bring the weight on to the right foot; the
club descends down through the arc it has described;
the right foot pivots, the forearms turn, the weight comes
almost wholly on the left foot and the club returns to
the ball exactly at right angles. The club head is ahead
of the hands and the ball is hit cleanly, the power coming
from the right arm. The follow through finds the weight
on the left foot, the right having only enough to preserve
the player’s balance.</p>

<p>It is on the drive and brassie stroke that “pressing” is
a severe fault. It is more important to hit true and to
preserve the right angle by following through than to
hit hard. Most girls do not hit a long ball. A far surer
game is the short game. Accurate strokes down the
middle of the fair green is sounder golf, so do not “press”
and do not try to kill the ball.</p>

<p>After the brassie and driver are mastered, one can
take up the mid-iron, cleek, niblic, spoon, and jigger
in the order named. These clubs are for special service,
and cannot be described in detail here.</p>

<p>An excellent practice to follow when taking up the
game for the first time is to devote a day or even a week to
each club, although it takes will-power to resist playing
with the whole set instead of one club. As you master a
club practice with it continuously. You will find such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
practice invaluable. Do not take up your second club
until you have thoroughly mastered the first. And as I
have said before, I would recommend that the game be
learned backward&mdash;so to speak&mdash;with putter first, then with
mashie, brassie, driver and down through the other clubs.</p>

<p>An adjacent golf course is a welcome requisite to a
girls’ school or club. It is desirable for athletic associations
or faculties to organize tournaments, as competition
usually heightens interest. Where skill is unequal handicaps
may be arranged by averaging a player’s scores and
allowing the differences between the average score and
par as a handicap. In this way evenness in competition
is assured. Usually matches are decided by the winning
of holes, although many competitions are decided
on medal score or the total strokes for 18 holes. There
are several kinds of tournaments possible in golf&mdash;two-ball
or four-ball matches, or best ball matches. The
last is where four players go around the course, two
playing against the other two and counting only the best
ball on each hole. Possibly the most satisfactory form
for a tournament to take is the round robin tournament,
where the number of entries is not too great, as each
player meets everyone entered. Where the entry list is
big the elimination tournament is most efficacious, and
when there is still a larger entry list it is well to divide
the players into first and second flights by first playing
a qualifying round, counting medal scores, the lowest
scores being grouped together in the first flight. A
match may be made even by handicaps when players
of varying skill are entered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<h2 id="Skating">Skating</h2>

<p>There are few forms of exercise that are more exhilarating
than skating. There seems to be a peculiar fascination
that holds you. There is a pleasing restfulness
and a soothing feeling while you are gliding over the
smooth ice. Surely there is nothing so interesting to
watch as good skating. An intangible quality seems to
draw you to it, to make you want to put on a pair of
skates and try it yourself. Out-of-doors skating is, of
course, preferable to rink skating, but the latter is a very
acceptable substitute.</p>

<p>“I have weak ankles. I can’t skate.” How many
times have girls offered this trite excuse! If anyone
really wants to learn to skate, with a little patience and
perseverance it can soon be accomplished.</p>

<p>The skates should be the right size for the shoe in order
to avoid any accident. The shoe should be high, and not
too stiff at the ankles. It is advisable to have the
shoe and skate fastened together. The skates should be
always well wiped, sharp and in good condition.</p>

<p>The skater must learn straight skating, that is,
moving forward by long slides on each foot alternately
while the foot not on the ice is held up backward and
outward from the ice, before attempting intricacies.</p>

<p>To learn the elementals of straight skating, start with
the left foot. This foot slides forward on the flat of the
skate, the toe turned out; the left knee is bent, the weight
of the body is forward, thus giving momentum to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
slide. The right foot is back, raised a few inches. When
the momentum is almost gone, then gripping the ice with
the toe of the left foot, the right foot starts its slide.
As the right starts, the left foot is lifted ready for the
glide, and so on, skating straight ahead.</p>

<p>Skating backward is learned in the same manner, except
that the back of the foot is turned out instead of the
toe.</p>

<p>It requires practice in order to perfect these two forms
of straight skating. They should be acquired and thoroughly
mastered, so that the skater glides over the ice
with ease and skill before any dancing or continental
skating is attempted.</p>

<p>There are several points of form that should be brought
to mind. The slides or strokes should always be of equal
length and as long as possible. If one foot is stronger
than the other, then particular attention should be paid
to the weaker foot. The skating knee is always bent.
The foot not in use is stretched outward and downward,
toe pointed downward. The body is carried well forward,
head erect; the arms move rhythmically, but not in an
exaggerated position. The body must not be stiff. There
should be no rigid muscles at all.</p>

<p>It is not the hurried, quick strides with a body bent
over in a grotesque fashion that constitutes good skating,
but the long, even glides, with the body poised
naturally and responding to the rhythm of the motion.</p>

<p>Continental skating has in the last few years proved
to be very popular. It is impossible to give a detailed
account of all the intricate figures in a comparatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
limited space. The more elementary school figures, however,
can easily be explained. The skate has an inside
and an outside edge, and progress may be made either
forward or backward on either edge. Thus, there are four
edges: forward outside edge, backward outside edge, forward
inside edge, backward inside edge.</p>

<p>For the forward outside edge a circle is described on
the outer edge of the skate. The first stroke is on the right
foot. The start is obtained by a push from inside edge
of the skate of the left foot. The body leans toward
the circle.</p>

<p>For the backward outside edge, the circle is described
on the outer edge of the skate. This is like the forward
outside edge, only much more difficult; the body leans
in toward the circle and backward.</p>

<p>The forward inside edge is a circle described on the
inside edge of the skate; the outer shoulder is turned
as far out and forward, the inner shoulder is turned back,
the body leans toward the middle of the circle. When
the circle is almost complete, the free foot is brought
forward, the shoulders straightened.</p>

<p>The backward inside edge is more difficult, but the theory
is the same as the forward inside edge. The foot at
completion is carried back, not forward, however.</p>

<p>These are fundamentals for figure skating and should
be practised carefully. After the edges, the five threes,
the loops, the brackets, the four rockers, and the four
counters are learned. These are easily learned if the
four edges have been perfected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<h2 id="Ice_Hockey">Ice Hockey</h2>

<p>One of the most enjoyable and thrilling of the skating
pastimes is ice hockey. For this a special hockey skate
is made.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How the Game is Played.</span></h3>

<p>The game is played by two teams with six or seven
players. The players hit a small piece of rubber, called
the puck, with sticks especially made. These sticks are
long and slender, flat at the blade, which is at an angle
from the handle. The ball is advanced up and down
the rink or playing area. A point is scored when one
team shoots the puck through the opponents’ goal. The
team wins which has the highest number of points at the
end of the game, which is divided into two halves of
twenty minutes each with a ten-minute intermission between
the halves.</p>

<p>The playing area is usually 112 feet long by 58 feet
wide. There are two goal posts at each end of the playing
area, 10 feet from the edge of the ice; the posts are
4 feet high and are 6 feet apart. A sloping net should
be placed in back to catch the balls.</p>

<p>The game is started with the puck in the middle of the
ice, i. e., the referee places the puck between the sticks
of two opposing players, each of whom tries to get
possession of the ball or pass it to one of her teammates.
The game is a very fast one. The four forward
players, the rover (right center) and the left center, and
the right and left wings, are essentially attackers, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the rover may be called upon to defend. Cover point,
point, and goal keeper are the defense players. The goal
keeper should stick close to her goal; the point plays in
front of the goal, some distance from her; the cover
point plays some distance in front of the point and can
often aid the forwards by feeding them and assuming an
aggressive play.</p>

<p>If the puck goes out of bounds over the end lines it is
faced, by the referee, five yards within the goal line and
at right angles to it. If it goes over the side lines it is
faced five yards within the line and at right angles to it.</p>

<p>The puck is played by means of the stick. It is not
permissible to touch it with any part of the body, except
to stop it dead or block it. The puck may be pushed,
shoved, or lifted, i. e., by inserting the blade of the stick
under the puck. You may hit your opponent’s stick.</p>

<p>You may body check, that is, shove from the side or
front with the shoulder or hip.</p>

<p>You may block an opponent or you may block the
puck with the skates, stick, or body.</p>

<p>An important rule is that of off-side. No player, if she
is between the puck and her opponent’s goal, may receive
a pass from one of her team unless it is touched by an
opponent, or unless one of own team with the puck is
between her and the opponents’ goal. The penalty for
off-side play is facing the ball where the foul occurred.
This rule does not hold in defense directly in front of the
goal. One point is scored when the puck passes between
the goal posts lower than their highest point.</p>

<p>The teams change goals to begin the second half.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>The fouls are:</p>

<p>To lift the stick above the shoulder except when lifting
the puck.</p>

<p>To throw a stick.</p>

<p>To hit, trip, or block a player by holding the stick in
a horizontal position.</p>

<p>To body check or charge from behind, to trip, kick,
push, hold with hand or stick.</p>

<p>For the goal keeper to sit, kneel, or lie.</p>

<p>To grasp, carry, or push the puck with any part of
the body.</p>

<p>To interfere with a player not in possession of the puck.</p>

<p>The penalty for a foul is: The offender may be ruled
off the ice for a certain time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Officials.</span></h3>

<p>There is a referee who controls the game and inflicts
the penalties.</p>

<p>There are two umpires, one at each end, to decide
whether a goal has been made. There are two timekeepers
to keep the time of the game and a penalty timekeeper
who keeps the time of players ruled out and notifies
the player when she may return to the game.</p>

<p>There is for each team a captain, who makes the decisions
for her team, and she is responsible for the good
sportsmanship of her team.</p>

<p>There are many little tricks in ice hockey that may
be acquired with practice, but the object of the game
should be to have as clean and fast a game as possible,
where skillful playing holds greater sway than roughness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<h2 id="Rowing">Rowing</h2>

<p>Very lucky is the school or college that has the necessary
facilities for rowing. Wherever this form of sport
is indulged in, it is generally popular. It deserves its
popularity, for not only is it one of the most pleasant
outdoor recreations but it is also very beneficial, since
it brings into play practically all the muscles in the body.</p>

<p>In rowing, as in other sports, there is a great difference
between competitive and non-competitive work. Whether
racing or merely taking a pleasure row, the stroke is,
however, fundamentally the same.</p>

<p>First, the position in the boat is to be considered.
The oarsman sits in the center of the boat with her back
toward the bow, facing the stern, with her feet planted
firmly on the bottom of the boat, knees bent, slightly
apart. An oar is grasped firmly in each hand, the oars
having previously been adjusted in the oar-locks. There
is a difference in the racing stroke, as shown under
Racing.</p>

<p><i>Position of the Hands on the Oar.</i>&mdash;Next to be considered
is the stroke itself. The blade of the oar is just
above the water and perpendicular to it. The arms and
hands are straight, so that the hands holding the oars
are just above the toes.</p>

<p><i>Catch.</i>&mdash;Then the blades enter the water, turned forward
so that they are held in the water vertically. The
body is then swung backward from the hips; all the
strength and weight of the body are put to the oars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p><i>Pull.</i>&mdash;As the body is swinging backward, the arms are
bent into the chest. The blade of the oar is kept under
water during the entire length of the pull.</p>

<p><i>Recovery.</i>&mdash;As the hands touch the chest, the forearm is
dropped quickly, thus causing the blade to leave the water.</p>

<p><i>Feathering.</i>&mdash;The blade is carried a few inches above
and horizontal to the water. It is gradually turned, as
the catch is reached, to a perpendicular position, ready
to enter the water as the arms are straightened ready
for the catch.</p>

<p><i>Legs.</i>&mdash;Where a sliding seat is used the object is to
combine the use of the arms and legs in making the sweep
of the oar longer, at full reach the body being doubled
up with the knees under the chin, the stroke consisting
of catching the water with the back and forcing it
through to the finish by combined action of back and
legs. When the finish is reached the legs are straight,
the hands and oar are against the chest, and the body
slightly back of the perpendicular.</p>

<h3>Racing</h3>

<p>The racing stroke is the same, except that for the four
and eight-oared crews each oarsman pulls one oar, known
as a “sweep,” holding it in both hands&mdash;the inside hand
at the end of the oar, the outside hand a hand’s breadth
away. The boats used for racing are known as “shells,”
especially made for the purpose. These have sliding seats
and are equipped with either oar-locks or thole pins
(according to the belief of the coach) and stretchers, or
boards against which the feet rest. When the body is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
forward, the sliding seat is forward toward the bow; as
the pull is starting, the seat comes back until the body
is back, then it moves forward as body swings forward.</p>

<p>In racing, the shell is steered by a coxswain, who sits
in the stern facing the oarsmen and holds the lines which
guide the rudder. This is very important, since she tries
to choose the best and most favorable course. She must
observe all conditions closely. She alters the course as
little as possible, taking care not to jerk or in any way
interfere with running of the boat. She also judges the
stroke, that is, when the stroke should be faster or
slower.</p>

<p>The stroke oar is the most important position in the
boat, since all the others time their strokes according to
<i>hers</i>, either faster or slower, according to the necessity.</p>

<p>Above everything necessary in racing is a good coach,
who watches carefully for any signs of fatigue or over-exertion.
It never pays in the long run to overdo.
The crew should work smoothly, harmoniously and
with perfect mastery of the stroke. This can be obtained
through the supervision of the coach, who criticises the
individual and the whole. In arranging a crew the
heavier girls are in the center, the lighter at either end;
the coxswain should be as small and light as possible,
thus not adding much unused weight.</p>

<p>In the single and double sculls&mdash;that is, boats rowed by
one or two oarsmen&mdash;an oar is grasped in each hand.
The sculler steers by pulling evenly on both oars for a
straight course, or more strongly on one or the other
oar for a variation of the course.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rules for Racing.</span></h3>

<p>Boat races, or regattas, are held on fixed courses for
measured distances. In choosing a course, the natural and
local conditions have to be considered. The most desirable
are straightaway over inland waters with no, or little,
current. If the course is in tidal water, the race should
be so timed that it is not necessary for the crew to row
against the tide.</p>

<p>The start and the finish are marked by flags. The
stern must be on a line with the start. The bow first
crossing the finish line wins. A tie is usually rowed over
again.</p>

<p>The start is generally made at the pistol shot, fired by
the official starter. Each boat has been assigned to a
course, decided by lot. The winner has first choice and
should make the most of the opportunity, considering
position, tide, wind and other local conditions. No crew
may go into another’s course.</p>

<p>If the course is not straightaway, each boat must turn
around the turning stake in its own course.</p>

<p>Besides an official starter, there is an umpire who
judges the races; a judge or judges of the finish.</p>

<p>The different kinds of crews are: Single&mdash;one oarsman;
doubles&mdash;two oarsmen, each pulling two oars;
pairs&mdash;two oarsmen each pulling one oar; fours&mdash;four
oarsmen each with one oar; eights&mdash;each with one oar.</p>

<h3>Paddling</h3>

<p>Closely allied to rowing is paddling. This is done in a
canoe by one, two, or more people. If by one, she seats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
herself in the stern, facing the bow; if two, one is in the
stern and one is in the bow, back toward the stern. There
are rarely more than three or four in a canoe, the average
being two people to a canoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Rowing is eagerly participated in by the girls at Wellesley College. The formation of the
star shows how proficient they have become in handling the oars.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The tennis enthusiast will not admit there is a more fascinating, healthful or elevating sport in the whole
world. Wellesley College provides plenty of tennis courts and the setting is ideal.</p></div>

<p>The Indians of the Canadian backwoods usually delegate
the responsibility of steering to the bow man because
of rough water or the danger from submerged
rocks in swift running streams. Usually, in more civilized
waters, the steering is done by the paddler in the stern,
who, by a twist of the wrists, turns the blade of the
paddle toward the canoe or away, according to the direction
desired. The paddle is held in both hands; the
near hand is held pretty far down the blade, more than
shoulder’s width from far hand, which is held over the
top of the paddle. There are many forms of paddling;
some prefer straight, others bent arms. The reach with
the paddle should not be so far ahead of the paddler that
she is forced to lean forward. The paddle is brought out
of the water when both arms are straight back, body in
a normal position. It is carried forward but a few inches
above the water with blade flat.</p>

<p>An Indian custom that has come down to us is the
double paddle. The paddle is fashioned with a handle
in the middle and paddles at either end. The paddler
sits in the center of the canoe. First the paddle is dipped
in the water at the left and then to the right. Steering
is done by turning the paddle, in or out, as you would
go, left or right. The double paddle is fascinating, but
hardly so safe for the novice as the single.</p>

<p>Practice and experience are the two best teachers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<h2 id="Tennis">Tennis</h2>

<p>Tennis scarcely needs an introduction. It is one of
the finest games&mdash;for girls or men&mdash;we have, and it has
proved its worth through years and years of play.</p>

<p>Tennis is played on a rectangular court, either of turf,
clay or cement, provided that it is level. The dimensions
of the court for doubles are 36 by 78 feet. The 78-foot lines
are known as the side lines; the others as the end or base
lines. Parallel to each base line and 18 feet distant from
are two service lines, drawn from side service line to side
service line. Parallel to each side line and 4&frac12; feet distant
from them is a side service line, drawn from end line
to end line. A line exactly in center joins the two service
lines, thus making four service courts. The net is
stretched exactly across the center of the court, and
should be 3 feet high in the middle. It is desirable that
there be no obstructions within 3 feet of the court on
the side and 12 feet at ends, and that there should be
backstops of considerable height. The posts to which
net is attached should be 3 feet away from the court.</p>

<p>The game may be played by two, three or four players,
who bat a ball across the net with a racket until one or
the other fails to return the ball. If only two play (or, as it
is termed, “singles”), the side lines are dispensed with and
the side service lines are the boundary lines (27 × 78 feet).</p>

<p>The ball is put in play by the server. The courts and
service are determined by a toss; the winner may choose
either the end of court or the serve, but not both. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
server, standing on the right-hand side of her base line,
with feet behind the line, sends the ball into her opponent’s
right-hand court. The player receiving ball after
it has bounced must return it over the net so that it
touches inside the court; then the server returns, etc.,
until there is a failure to return the ball. This counts
a point for opposing player of the one who makes the
fault. Then the ball is again served, this time from the
left-hand side, next from the right, continuing to alternate
until the game is finished. A game is always begun by
serving from the right-hand court.</p>

<p>The game is won when a player has scored four points,
except in the case of deuce, when more are necessary.
The first point is “15;” the second, “30;” the third, “40;”
the fourth, “game.” If both players have “15,” it is
“15-all;” if one, “15-love (or naught).” The server’s
score is always called first. If both have 30, 30-all; if
one has 30, the other none or 15, it is 30-love, or 30-15.
If both have 40, it is “deuce.” In deuce it is necessary
to play extra points. The first point won is “advantage
in” (server) or “out” (striker), as may be the case; the
next point if won by the same player is game, but if won
by the other player it is deuce again, and so on until one
player wins two points in succession.</p>

<p>The server, after the first game, becomes the receiver,
and the serve is alternated with each game until the end
of the set. A set consists of six games won by one player,
unless the opposing player is less than two games behind,
that is, a set cannot end at 6/5, but must be played until
one or the other obtains a two-game lead. Ends of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
court are exchanged after each set. The server should
always keep the score.</p>

<p>It is the aim of the players to return as many good
balls as possible. A ball is “good” when it is sent within
the court. It is a “fault” when it hits outside the boundary
lines, or does not clear the net&mdash;a ball, however,
which touches net but still falls on the right side (a “let
ball”) is “good.” Faults count one point for opponent
or opponents. Other faults that count for opponent
are: Server serves two faults in succession; volleying
the ball before it has touched the net; volleying a
served ball before it bounds (any other ball may be
volleyed); failure to return a ball. It is a fault to touch
net while ball is in play, or to touch the ball with any
part of person except the racket, or to touch ball with
racket twice.</p>

<p>The receiver may hit the ball in the air (except serve)
or after the first bounce, but may never hit after the
second bounce.</p>

<p>A player in tennis must never be caught napping.
Tennis calls for wide awake, quick playing. It is best
to stand either near the net or back farther toward the
service line. For most girls I would recommend the base
line game. Never stand where your opponent can drop
a ball directly at your feet; always be ready for her.
You must always watch where she is and try to place
the ball in the spot most difficult for her to reach.</p>

<p>In order to be ready the racket should be held firmly
and easily so that it may be prepared for any stroke.
Above all, keep your eye on the ball; if you look at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
place you want to hit the ball and not at the ball, you
do not hit it squarely and you give your play away.
When you receive, do not stand too far away or too near.
If you are too far away, you are apt to tip it; if too near,
you bend your arm and do not get a good stroke.</p>

<p>The game of tennis is divided into two main divisions,
serving and receiving. First, let us take up serving.
This is the method of putting the ball in play. The server
must stand behind the base line of the court. She must
serve her ball into the diagonally opposite service court.
She is allowed two balls; if the first is a fault she is allowed
to serve the second. To be a good ball it must touch
the ground in the service court, fairly clearing the net.
A double fault on the part of the server counts a point
for the opposing side, that is, it is a fault to serve two
balls which do not clear the net, or do not touch inside
the service court. When the ball touches the net but
goes into the proper service court, it is called a “let ball”
and does not count, but is served over again. Failure to
return the ball after it is served counts one point for
the server. The server must not step across the base
line while serving, nor must she step, hop, walk or run.</p>

<p>In serving it is important to study the grip of the
racket, the method of hitting the ball, and the way to
toss the ball into the air. The racket is held tightly in
the hand by what is known as the long grip, hand at the
end of the racket&mdash;usually the right hand. There are
many different swings and twists used. It is best to adopt
one that brings into play the full strength of the arm
and shoulder, thus an overhead swing of the racket is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
most often used. The ball is tossed into the air and the
racket, in its exact center, should hit the ball directly
over the net into the opposite service court. Before a
cut or a speedier serve is developed, the player should
make sure of a steady ball that as a rule is good. After
that is acquired, practice the cuts and put as much speed
as possible into the serve. It is very important that the
ball and the racket should meet at the psychological
moment. If the ball is hit too low, it does not clear the
net; if it is hit while too high in the air, it goes out of the
service court. The follow through of the stroke should
be natural and never chopped.</p>

<p>In receiving and returning the ball there are many
different strokes to use. It is advisable for the beginner
to perfect both forehand and backhand strokes. For
these strokes, the racket should be held in the short grip,
that is, the end of the racket is at the wrist, hand reaching
up the handle; the forearm should be in a line with
the racket.</p>

<p>One stroke, the drop stroke, the arm is back of the
body, extended to full length; then move&mdash;rather sweep&mdash;forward
to meet the ball as it is about waist high, giving
a little upward turn to your racket. Always follow
through. The arm should be straight in this stroke.</p>

<p>Besides a forehand stroke, a backhand stroke is also
necessary to learn. In the forehand, the weight is on
the right foot, but in the backhand it is on the left foot.
There are many different kinds, but the most natural is
the best for the beginner to use. The arm and racket,
of course, are across the body. Swing back and meet the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
ball squarely, with body turned greatly to that side.
Be careful to follow through.</p>

<p>A great many people spoil their game of tennis by
wild playing and smashes. It is much better to be deliberate
and calculating, carefully placing your shots out
of reach of your opponent. Try to make every play count.
In other words, use your head rather than brute strength.</p>

<p>A good racket&mdash;carefully chosen for weight and balance
and to which you have become accustomed&mdash;practice, a
deliberate study of the game and your playing&mdash;these
will help the average player.</p>

<p>The most suitable dress for tennis is a light weight waist
or a middy blouse; a short, wide skirt, and rubber or
felt-soled flat-heeled shoes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tennis Matches or Tournaments.</span></h3>

<p>For a tennis match there should be an official referee,
who determines questions concerning the rules; an umpire,
who judges all balls except those on the lines, which are
judged by the linesmen; a linesman for each of the seven
lines, whose duty it is to judge the ball near her line.
There may be a scorer, but this duty is generally assumed
by the umpire, who announces each point, the score of
each game, and how the sets stand.</p>

<p>Each player should enter her name in advance; then
each draws for opponent, the winner of one match
meeting the winner of another, etc., until the final match
is played. This is an elimination tournament. In
doubles, the pair may be entered or the partner may be
drawn for.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>A favorite form of tournament where the number of
entrants is small is the round robin tournament, where
each contestant meets every other, irrespective of victories.
The championship with its trophy is given to
the girl winning the greatest number of matches.</p>

<p>Tournament play is greatly to be recommended,
especially for schools or clubs. Match play adds considerably
to the pleasure of the sport and usually has
beneficial results, both physical and physiological. I
have seen diffident girls taught to gain self control and
composure at all times by competitive athletics. A
tennis tournament can be made a gala social event as
well as one of keen and interesting sport.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<h2 id="Cricket">Cricket</h2>

<p>Cricket is not widely played by girls, but there is no
game which might be adopted to better advantage. It
may be played without any danger of over-exertion.
A cricket crease may be placed on any level grassy field,
usually a ground 100 yards square, although a smaller
field may be utilized. The equipment required includes
two sets of wickets, a cricket ball, at least two bats,
the wicket-keeper gloves and leg guards, and a leg guard
for each of two batsmen who are in. There are eleven
players on each team and the game is divided into innings;
that is, a side has its inning when it is at the bat.
Two batsmen are “in” at a time.</p>

<p>The wickets are set in the middle of the field, opposite,
parallel and 22 yards apart. On a line with the wicket
is the bowling crease, 8 feet 8 inches in length. Four
feet in front and parallel to it is the popping crease, of
unlimited length.</p>

<p>The batsman who is first striker takes her position
with bat on the popping crease, the bowler at the opposite
wicket, well behind bowling crease; also the second
batsman, bat in hand, ready to run when hit is made.
The bowler delivers the ball. It must be bowled, not
thrown, tossed, or jerked. The bowler is allowed a run
in her delivery, but she must keep one foot on the ground
behind the bowling crease and within the return crease,
otherwise it is no ball.</p>

<p>The bowler must deliver the ball so that it shall come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to the batsman on the ground. If it is delivered high
or wide, the umpire shall call “wide ball.” Six good
balls make an “over;” the bowler shall be allowed to
change ends when she pleases, provided she has not
bowled two “overs” consecutively in one inning. The
captain of the outs places the field as she deems wise,
depending upon the skill of the batsman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_098b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SAMPLE SCORING SHEET.</p></div>

<p>The striker hits the ball; if it is caught before it touches
the ground she is out; if the wicket is knocked down by
a bowled ball she is out. If she hits it safe she runs to
the return crease and the other batsman runs to the
opposite popping crease and a run is scored. If the hit
is long enough the batsmen continue to run, and each
time they exchange creases a run is counted. The fielders
endeavor to get the ball and throw in to the wicket-keeper
in order to knock off the bails before the batsman touches
her bat to the ground within the crease. When the bail is
knocked off in this manner the batsman is out. When
a batsman is out for any cause she is retired for the
inning, and the side is retired when ten of the eleven
strikers are declared out.</p>

<p>Usually in the matches for girls only one inning for
each team is played, although the rules call for two and
three-day matches. The game affords ample opportunity
for outdoor exercise and muscular activity. For a
full description, see Spalding’s “How to Play Cricket.”</p>

<p>Cricket has been successfully played by girls. Miss
Dorothy Wooster writes the following short article and
gives a diagram and score card showing how the game
is played at Smith College.

<p>In order to adapt cricket for practical use, the following
additions and changes have been made in the official
rules, as published in the Spalding Athletic Library.</p>

<p class="large"><i>A. Additions</i>:</p>

<p>1. Diagram of Field: Use center line, “<i>x</i>,” drawn
between wickets. Cross this line by another line, “<i>y</i>,”
drawn parallel to the popping crease.</p>

<p>2. There shall be 3 innings to a game, each inning
consisting of 3 “outs” on a side.</p>

<p>3. There shall be a definite batting order.</p>

<p>4. If a batter touches the ball with the bat she must
run, or take her “out.”</p>

<p class="large"><i>B. Changes in Rules</i>:</p>

<p>10. ... and to be a good ball, the ball must hit the
ground on or across the center line “<i>y</i>.”</p>

<p>13. A “Bowling Over” shall consist of six “good
balls,” or four “wide balls,” or four “no balls.”</p>

<p>33A. ... except in case of a “Caught Ball.” The
ball is then in play until it is settled in bowler’s or
wicket-keeper’s hand. This change gives an opportunity
to put two runners out on one play; i. e., “Caught
Out” and “Run Out.”</p>

<p>The scoring has been simplified. For practice games,
when full teams are not present, an individual score is
kept. Using these changes the game progresses rapidly
and holds the interest of both players and spectators.

<h2 id="Soccer">Soccer</h2>

<p>Soccer or association football is a particularly suitable
game for girls and women, since it furnishes splendid
outdoor exercise without unnecessary roughness. It
resembles field hockey in that it is mainly a running
game, although there are many essential differences. The
popularity of the game is rapidly increasing and it is
played by many schools and colleges.</p>

<p>The game is primarily a running and kicking game.
No player but the goal keeper in her own goal area is
permitted to touch the ball with the hands. Two teams
of eleven players each line up in their half of the field.
The captains toss for the choice of end or for the choice
of the kick-off. In making the choice, the wind and the
position of the sun should be considered. The ball is
put in play by a kick-off. To advance the ball to
the opponents’ goal and to kick the ball between the
goal posts and under the bar is the object of the game.
Each goal counts one. The team having the highest score
at the end of the two halves&mdash;time of which is determined
by the captains&mdash;is the winner. Thus the two opposing
teams are either attacking or defending. If one side has
possession of the ball it should advance toward the opponents’
goal, thus attacking; if the ball is not in their
possession they are checking their opponents’ advance,
thus defending. The players who do most of the attacking
are the five forwards, assisted by the halfbacks. It
is their duty to advance the ball by short and long passes,
by dribbling, by a volley, i. e., hitting the ball with head
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
or chest, or kicking it before it has touched the ground.
The fullbacks and goal keeper, assisted by the halfbacks,
do the defensive work.</p>

<p>The positions are: center forward, inside right and
inside left, outer right and outer left; left, center, and
right halfbacks; right and left fullbacks; goal keeper.</p>

<p>The beginner in soccer should pay particular attention
to the following: kicking, tackling, heading, and dribbling.
The ball is not kicked with the end of toe, but
rather the toe is inserted under the ball, the instep bearing
the brunt of the work. The leg should be drawn back
to get a good drive. Kicking is not merely sending the
ball as far and hard as possible, but kicking as accurately
as possible so that each shot tells. Therefore,
particular attention and practice should be given to kicking
until the proper amount of control can be exercised
over the ball. Every kick should be gotten off quickly
and cleanly, toe well under the ball so that it is raised.</p>

<p>In shooting for the goal the kick should be hard, with
all the force of the toe behind it. In all defensive work
the kicks should be carefully sent to the forwards; not
too hard, since the ball then may go too far.</p>

<p>The player should learn to kick with either foot so
that the ball does not have to be maneuvered into a suitable
position for kicking.</p>

<p>Every player&mdash;the forwards in particular&mdash;should
know how to dribble, since it is frequently a handy art.
Often, if a player wishes to get in a better position for a
kick, a few dribbles will put her there. To dribble successfully,
the ball is moved forward, just touching the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
toe, thus insuring complete control. For the inexperienced
player, control in dribbling and speed seem a hard
combination to achieve; but by practice, dribbling slowly
at first, control is acquired and speed soon follows.</p>

<p>A common fault sometimes due to dribbling is the
monopoly of the ball by one player. Any individual
should be self-sacrificing for the good of the team.</p>

<p>Stopping the progress of an opponent, or “tackling”
as it is termed, should be carefully practised, particularly
by the defense. The best policy seems&mdash;to run directly
toward the player with the ball, thus making her pass
hurriedly or fumble. Never give up if your opponent
gets away, dodges or slips past you.</p>

<p>Many times it is an advantage to “head” the ball,
that is, hit it with the head before it touches the ground.
When the players are massed together, a jump in the
air and good “heading” may save the day. Remember
that the ball ought to be hit with the forehead, not the
top of the head. This makes for accuracy.</p>

<p>There should be, as in all other team games, team work.
The forwards should bear the responsibility of the attack.
They should carry the ball down the field by
passing, dribbling and volleying, i. e., hitting the ball
in the air before it has touched the ground. Forwards
should know how to shoot hard and accurately. It is
well for a forward to know how to shoot and pass with the
inside of the foot. In dribbling and in passing, the
forward must remember to pass quickly to some one of
her team who is unguarded. You should always be
waiting to receive a pass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>The outsides are generally fast players with great skill
in the dribble; the insides, like the center, are fine offensive
players, fast and capable of shooting goals.</p>

<p>The halfbacks feed and help the forwards attack, shooting
for the goal if the opportunity arises. The attack
should be constantly varied by these players. The halfbacks
are also the first line of defense, necessarily they
have a great deal of running to do. These three positions
are generally filled then by players physically fit,
with speed and with stamina for endurance. Center
half is a particularly strenuous position. The halves
should always try to keep the ball in the opponents’
territory; when on the defense, they should be quick to
tackle, to intercept passes and to guard their opponents.</p>

<p>The fullbacks are the mainstay of the defense. They
are cool-headed players who use great judgment. It is
up to them to block any opponent who has gotten by a
halfback. Often the fullbacks have so carefully studied
their opponents’ play that they know exactly what the
forward will do under certain circumstances. Above all,
the fullbacks should never give up.</p>

<p>The goal is a very vital point. To be a goal keeper,
you must think quickly, keep your nerve, be cool and
act instantly according to your judgment. In fact, a
goal keeper should be able to cover every inch of the goal
in an instant; she must be able to move rapidly, jump,
and reach into the air. Two points a goal keeper should
remember: Never kick when you can use your hands&mdash;you
can get rid of the ball quicker and for better distance.
Get the ball out of dangerous territory as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Dress is an important consideration. The essentials
are a middy blouse, a short, wide skirt or bloomers,
with heavy enough shoes to allow for kicking and yet
light enough to permit of speed in covering ground.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soccer Rules.</span></h3>

<p class="copy">[From Spalding’s Athletic Library No. 358&mdash;Official College Soccer Guide.]</p>

<p>I. There are eleven players on a team.</p>

<p>II. The field of play is a quadrangle. Its dimensions vary
from 130 to 100 yards in length and from 100 to 50 yards in
breadth. A smaller field, as near these dimensions as possible,
may be used. The lines, areas, etc., do not vary with any
change in size of the field, however. Flags on five-foot staffs
are placed at each of the four corners. The lines are distinctly
marked with whitewash if possible. The quadrangle is bounded
by two end or “goal” lines and two side or “touch” lines which
are at right angles with the goal lines. The field is exactly
halved by a cross line. In the center of the field of play is a
circle with a ten-yard radius. The goals are marked by goal
posts, eight feet apart, in the middle of the goal line, equidistant
from the side lines. The posts are joined by a cross-bar eight
feet from the ground, and neither the posts nor cross-bar are
more than five inches in width. At each end of the field in front
of the goal is a goal area. Lines are marked six yards from each
goal post at right angles to the goal line, extending in field for
six yards. These two lines are connected by a line parallel to
the goal line. The enclosed space is a goal area.</p>

<p>There is also a penalty area in front of each goal. Lines are
marked 18 yards from each goal post at right angles to the goal
lines, extending in field for a distance of 18 yards. These two
lines are joined by a line parallel to the goal lines.</p>

<p>A mark 12 yards distant from and opposite the exact center of
each goal designates the penalty kick mark.</p>

<p>The ball should be a regulation association football.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>III. The game is divided into two halves, each 45 minutes
long, with an interval of five minutes between the halves unless
a different length of time is agreed upon by the captains. Ends
are changed at half time.</p>

<p>IV. The choice of end or kick-off is decided by the toss of a
coin. The game is started by a place-kick, i. e., the ball is
placed on the ground and kicked from this position in the center
of the field. All opponents are more than ten yards away;
no player may cross center of the ground until the ball is kicked.
After a goal is scored the ball is kicked off by the team which
did not score the goal. At the beginning of the second half the
ball is kicked by the opposing side from the side that kicked first.</p>

<p>V. A goal is scored when the ball passes between the goal
posts under the bar, provided that it has not been thrown,
knocked, or carried.</p>

<p>VI. When the ball goes out of bounds over the touch line,
a player of the opposite side from that playing it out, throws it
in. She must stand on the touch line facing the field of play;
the ball may be thrown in any direction, provided it is thrown
over the head with both hands. A goal may not be scored from
a throw-in. The thrower-in may not touch the ball until it
has been touched by another player.</p>

<p>When the ball goes out of bounds over the goal line, played
over by an attacker, it is kicked off by a defender, within the
half of the goal area nearest the point where the ball went out.
If it was sent out by a defender, it is kicked by an attacker from
a point within one yard of nearest corner flag. No player in
either case may be within 10 yards of the ball until the kick-off
is taken.</p>

<p>VII. If, after the ball has been played or thrown in, it is
touched by a player on the same side as the person last touching
it, who at the moment of playing is nearer her opponents’ goal
than the person last playing the ball, she is off-side and may not
interfere with the ball or opponent. <i>She is not offside</i>, however,
if at the time of play there are at least three of her opponents
between her and the goal, or if she is within her own half of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
field, or in a corner kick, or if the ball was last touched by an
opponent.</p>

<p>VIII. The goal keeper may use her hands to catch or to throw
the ball if she is within her own penalty area.</p>

<p>IX. There should be no tripping, kicking, striking, jumping
at, handling (except in Rule VI), holding, pushing, obstructing,
or charging from behind. The goal keeper may be charged if
she is holding the ball, or obstructing or outside her own goal
area. The penalty for a foul is a free kick.</p>

<p>X. A free kick is taken for any infringement of a rule. The
ball must roll over&mdash;travel the distance of its circumference&mdash;to
be considered played. No opponent may stand within 10 yards
unless standing on own goal line. The kicker may not touch
the ball a second time until it has been touched by another
player. A goal may be scored from a free kick if it is granted
for any breaking of Rule VII.</p>

<p>XI. Any intentional infringement by either the attackers or
defenders outside the penalty area, a free kick is awarded to
opposing side.</p>

<p>If, however, there is an intentional foul by the defenders
within the penalty area, a penalty kick is granted to the opposing
side. All players except the goal keeper and a player from the
opposing side who is to take the kick remain outside the penalty
area. The goal keeper must not advance beyond the goal line.
The ball is kicked forward and a goal may be scored from a
penalty kick. The ball must be kicked and may not be touched
again by the kicker until it has been touched by another player.</p>

<p>XII. There is a referee who controls the game and enforces
the rules. Her power in the game is supreme. The ball is in play
until the decision is given.</p>

<p>There are two linesmen who decide when the ball is out of
play, what player has the corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in.</p>

<p>The referee acts as timekeeper.</p>

<p>To restart the game stopped temporarily, the referee drops
the ball to the ground on the spot where it was when play was
suspended. The ball is in play when it touches the ground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<h2 id="Archery">Archery</h2>

<p>Archery might be classed as a pioneer sport for women.
The art of the bow and arrow has been exploited ever
since the written records of man. At the present time,
when such sports as basket ball, field hockey, track
athletics, etc., are the popular games, archery has been
less in favor. There is no reason why any athletic girl
who can run the hundred in good time, and acquit herself
creditably in any of the more strenuous sports, should
smile a supercilious smile at <i>Archery</i>&mdash;mere child’s play
in her mind. In fact, it is far from child’s play, and it has
all the advantages of wholesome outdoor competition.</p>

<p>In order to be successful at archery two things are
necessary&mdash;perseverance and a trained eye. Any girl
without particular athletic ability can learn how to hold
the bow and take aim. Both requisites may be acquired
through practice. There is no need for great strength or
for any violent exertion. It is particularly good for growing
girls where more violent exercise might be harmful.</p>

<p>The archer should look first to her bow, which should
be neither too heavy nor too strong. A beginner should
not use a bow that is heavy. The bow together with the
arrow should be tested and if it can be raised and drawn
without strain it has the proper weight. Another point
to be considered is steadiness; no bow should kick or jar
after the string is released.</p>

<p>The arrows should also be chosen carefully according
to weight and length. An arrow that is too heavy will
weaken the bow; an arrow that is too light will not fly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
truly. Arrows vary in length and should be chosen
according to length of arm, so that when the arrow is
drawn the proper form can be maintained. A right-handed
archer extends the left arm full length holding
the bow, while the right hand (grasping the string with
the notch of the arrow adjusted) should be at the right
cheek; therefore the length of the arrow should be governed
by the length of the left arm.</p>

<p>Bows vary from three feet to five feet six inches and
arrows from fifteen inches to twenty-five inches. The
arrows should be carefully kept when not in use. A
quiver and belt is a desirable added equipment. Some
archers find a bracer or arm guard necessary.</p>

<p>In shooting the arrow the first consideration is the
position of standing. The side of body should be directly
toward the target (or the point aimed at), the head turned
toward the target, looking over the shoulder. The feet&mdash;heels
slightly apart&mdash;should be at right angles to an imaginary
line drawn directly from target.</p>

<p>Next to be considered is nocking the arrow. The bow
should be held in a horizontal position, the arrow is laid
across the bow and the nock or notch of the arrow is
fitted on the string by the right hand.</p>

<p>The position of the hand is important. The string is
held by three fingers, the string resting near the tips of the
fingers above the first joint; the arrow rests between
the first and second fingers; the thumb and little finger
should not touch the arrow or the string.</p>

<p>Next comes the draw. Raise the bow hand, drawing
on the string slightly; take a preliminary sight; then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the draw is taken almost the full distance, the full aim
is caught, and the arrow is released when drawn to the
fullest extent. Another way is to raise the bow, draw to
the fullest extent, take aim by moving the hand on the
bow handle up or down as the need dictates; loose the
string by straightening the fingers while the hand is
drawn entirely back.</p>

<p>The archer should never shoot more than three arrows
in succession without resting. The fourth and succeeding
flights are apt to be inaccurate if the arms are the
least bit tired. Always be sure to shoot every arrow
carefully&mdash;never hurry.</p>

<p>The bows and arrows should be well taken care of.
They should be cleaned and wiped thoroughly after each
use. Never use a blunt arrow; it will not hold in the
target. The bow should always be unstrung after it is
used and strung before using again.</p>

<p>The arrow should be uniformly nocked at the same
point upon the string in order to insure accuracy. Thus,
it is desirable to wrap the string at the proper point
with a different colored thread.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Games.</span></h3>

<p>The most ancient form of archery is the so-called roving
game, which consists of roving about and shooting
at marks from various distances. Another form is flight
shooting&mdash;seeking to cast an arrow the greatest possible
distance.</p>

<p>Modern archery, however, is practically confined to
target shooting. A target is a flat disc, varying from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
eighteen inches to forty-eight inches in diameter. It is
marked by concentric rings or bands of different colors.
From center to the outer ring the colors are gold, red,
blue, black, and white; the latter is usually banded by a
narrow strip of green. The dimensions are: gold nine
and six-tenths inches, and the width of each of the other
rings is exactly half that amount.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tournament.</span></h3>

<p>The archer standing at a prescribed distance shoots
at the target, trying to make as many hits as possible
and to place the arrows in the gold. Three arrows are
usually shot at a time, then three more. The six arrows
form an end. A given number of ends form a range,
while two or three ranges form a round.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Score.</span></h3>

<p>A hit is counted if the arrow pierces the target. The
values of the different bands are: gold, 9; red, 7; blue, 5;
black, 3; white, 1. An arrow cutting or touching the
line between rings counts for the higher value. Also
one hit is counted if the arrow rebounds from face of
or if it passes through the body of the target; this adds
one point to the score.</p>

<p>The Rounds for Ladies are:</p>

<p>
I.&mdash;National Round.</p>
<p class="table">
48 arrows at 60 yards.<br />
24 arrows at 50 yards.<br />
</p>

<p>At the double of this the National Championship is
decided.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>
II.&mdash;Columbia Round.</p>
<p class="table">
24 arrows at 50 yards.<br />
24 arrows at 40 yards.<br />
24 arrows at 30 yards.<br />
</p>

<p>The Ladies’ Interclub team and mid-range matches
are contested with 96 arrows at 50 yards.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Archery Clubs.</span></h3>

<p>The sport of archery gives a splendid opportunity for
the formation of clubs with weekly or bi-weekly tournaments.
Groups of girls can adopt a color designating
teams where there are no other means of rivalry; thus,
team and individual trophies may be contested for.</p>

<p>The grounds for archery should be carefully chosen.
The most suitable ground is a level, grassy space with a
uniform background. It is well to see that no danger
can come to anyone through a flying arrow.</p>

<h2 id="Indoor_Base_Ball">Indoor Base Ball</h2>

<p>Indoor base ball, like basket ball, is a game that may
be played in the winter months in the gymnasium and
it may also be played outdoors in a comparatively small
space. When well played, it may become as exciting as
the outdoor game. Its similarity to the outdoor game
makes it easier for a majority of the players to understand
it quickly. The ball is pitched by a pitcher to a
batter who tries to hit it, in order to run to first base.
Each batter in turn tries to advance her teammates and
herself so that they each may touch each of the four
bases in turn, thus making a run. There are nine innings.
In each inning each team has a turn at bat, or
an opportunity to bring in runs. The three main points
are batting, pitching and fielding.</p>

<p>The pitcher throws the ball with a straight arm and
with an underarm throw. Of course, she endeavors to
find the batter’s weak spots and pitch accordingly. The
fewer hits made by the batter, the greater the glory of
the pitcher.</p>

<p>The batter must use common sense, and not let the
pitcher fool her. To make every hit count is the rule
for the batter; thus she must judge the ball, hit to a favorable
spot in the field, working with the object of advancing
such of her teammates already on the bases. The
base runner should always be wideawake, ready to take
advantage of any opportunities offered to her.</p>

<p>The fielders must be quick to judge a ball, quick to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
catch it, and throw immediately to the necessary spot to
head off any incipient scoring by a base runner.</p>

<p>A quick, well-played game of indoor base ball is lots
of fun.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Indoor Base Ball Rules.</span></h3>

<h4>THE DIAMOND OR INFIELD.</h4>

<p>The game is played on an indoor floor. The diamond or infield
is marked out at one end, the remaining floor is the outfield.
At each of the four corners of the diamond is a base, usually made
of canvas and half filled with sand. The distance along the sides
is 27 feet if possible. There should be a box for the pitcher, 7
by 3 feet, and 23 feet distant from center of home base. A batsman’s
box, one on each side of the home base, six inches distant
from the base. The boxes are each 4 by 3 and extend a foot in
front of a line drawn through center of the base and 3 feet behind.
Foul lines should be drawn from the home base to first
and from third to home, outside the side lines, so that the bases
are inside the foul lines.</p>

<h4>THE BALL AND BAT.</h4>

<p>The regulation indoor base ball and bat are used.</p>

<h4>THE PLAYERS.</h4>

<p>There may be seven to nine players on a side, placed in
position by the captain. There must be one player who stands
within the pitcher’s box and pitches the ball according to rule.
A substitute may be put in to run for a player by consent of
both captains.</p>

<h4>THE GAME.</h4>

<p>The game has nine innings for each side. If there is a tie the
game is continued by innings until one side has won, or game is
discontinued. Choice of innings is decided by the toss of a coin.</p>

<h4>THE SCORE.</h4>

<p>One run, i. e., one point to the side making the run, is scored
when a base runner runs to and touches each of the three bases
and touches home base before three players of her side are out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<h4>THE PITCHER.</h4>

<p>The pitcher delivers the ball with the arm parallel to the body.
The pitcher may not take more than one step.</p>

<h4>THE BALL.</h4>

<p>The ball is good if it passes over any portion of the home plate
no lower than the batsman’s knee and no higher than her shoulder.</p>

<p>It is counted a balk by the pitcher if she makes any motion
to deliver the ball without doing so or holds the ball so long as to
delay the game.</p>

<p>An illegal ball is delivered by the pitcher if she steps out of
box or takes more than one step while pitching that ball.</p>

<p>A dead ball is a pitched ball which strikes the batter.</p>

<p>A batted ball is fair unless it strikes outside the foul line first.</p>

<p>A blocked ball is a ball batted or thrown that is stopped or
handled by a person not playing. The ball is returned to the
pitcher and runners remain on the same bases.</p>

<p>A strike is:</p>

<p>1. A ball struck at by the batter without her touching it.</p>

<p>2. A foul tip caught.</p>

<p>3. A good ball, legally delivered by the pitcher, not struck at
by the batter.</p>

<p>4. A good ball which the batter deliberately interferes with.</p>

<p>A foul strike is a ball batted when the batter is out of her
position.</p>

<p>The batsman is out:</p>

<p>1. If she bats out of turn.</p>

<p>2. If she fails to take her position one minute after umpire
calls for batter.</p>

<p>3. If a foul hit made by her is caught by the catcher before
the ball touches the floor or the wall.</p>

<p>4. If she makes a foul strike.</p>

<p>5. If any attempt be made to hinder the catcher or if the
ball is intentionally fouled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>6. If, first base being occupied by a base runner, the batter
has three strikes, except when two players are already out.</p>

<p>7. If, on the third strike, she is hit by the ball. The base
runner must touch in regular order first, second, third and home
bases.</p>

<p>The batter is a base runner immediately after:</p>

<p>1. A fair hit.</p>

<p>2. Four balls.</p>

<p>3. Three strikes.</p>

<p>4. Illegal delivery by pitcher.</p>

<p>The player is granted one base for the above, also the player
may advance one base if:</p>

<p>1. Succeeding player is granted a base.</p>

<p>2. If umpire is struck by a batted or thrown ball.</p>

<p>3. If she is prevented from making a base by an adversary.</p>

<p>If the ball is fumbled on the third strike or fourth ball the
base runner may take as many bases as she can get.</p>

<p>The base runner may only leave her base when the ball has
been struck, or, if it is not struck, it has reached the catcher.</p>

<p>The base runner is brought back if:</p>

<p>1. She starts too soon.</p>

<p>2. For a foul strike.</p>

<p>3. A dead ball.</p>

<p>4. A foul hit not legally fielded. The pitcher must wait for her to return.</p>

<p>The base runner is out:</p>

<p>1. If having made a fair hit, this is fielded before it touches
the wall or floor.</p>

<p>2. If there is any intentional interference with the ball just
batted.</p>

<p>3. If the third strike is caught before touching the ground.</p>

<p>4. If, after three strikes or a fair hit, the base runner before
touching first base is touched by a fielder with the ball in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
hands, or if the ball is securely held by fielder touching first base
before the base runner touches first base.</p>

<p>5. If she does not run directly.</p>

<p>6. If she obstructs the fielder.</p>

<p>7. If she fails to touch the bases in regular order.</p>

<p>The base runners may be coached from the coacher’s box.</p>

<p>There are two umpires who control the game. One judges
all balls, strikes, blocks, dead balls, balks, illegal deliveries, fair
and foul hits, ground hits, foul strikes. All decisions at the
home plate are made by her. Time and play are called. She
stands in a position behind the catcher.</p>

<p>The other judges the base plays. She stands near base line
where she can best see field of play.</p>

<p>The two change positions at the end of each inning.</p>

<p>A regulation score card should be used.

<p>Hand ball is a game suitable for either indoor or outdoor
playing, in which two or four persons may participate.
The game is divided into two parts&mdash;offensive and
defensive. The server, or, if there are four playing, the
server and her partner, constitute the offensive; the receiver
or the receiving side, the defensive. The score
is made by the serving side upon an error by the receiving
side; if the server makes an error she loses the serve,
thus also the chance to score. The ball is batted with
the cupped hand against a wall or back board so that
it bounds within a given territory.</p>

<p>The server drops or bounces the ball and then hits it
on the rebound with the palm of hand against the wall,
so that it rebounds as far from the receiver as possible.
Control and speed are two important factors. In order
to obtain good control, the player should practice and
endeavor to place the ball where her opponent isn’t.
This requires careful observation of your opponent’s tactics.
After control comes speed; a speedy ball is always
hard to return.</p>

<p>For the defensive, the player should always try to be
in a good position to return any ball; thus, it is imperative
to be able to play the ball with either hand. It is safer
for the defensive player to play a conservative game
rather than a speedy one, for any error counts for the
other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>Every player should learn to serve well, to use control
and speed; every player should learn to become equally
efficient with either hand, batting the ball with straight
aim; every player should always remember to outmaneuver
her opponent and place the ball where it is most
difficult for her to return it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rules for American Hand Ball.</span></h3>

<p>A hand ball court consists of a floor, a wall or back board, and
field. The floor is usually 20 feet wide and 26 feet long, with a
service line, distinctly marked, drawn across the floor at the
middle point, 13 feet away, between the front line (end line 26 feet
away from the board) and the board. The floor is smooth but not
polished. The wall or back board is 10 feet high and 20 feet wide.
The field is the whole space including the floor and is 55 feet
wide and 40 feet long including the court.</p>

<p>A regulation hand ball (small hard-rubber ball hollow inside)
and gloves are used.</p>

<p>Points may only be scored by the side serving. Twenty-one
points are a game. Should each score twenty points, either side
must score two consecutive points on one serve to win.</p>

<p>There are two officials&mdash;a referee and an umpire&mdash;who have
control of the game, who decide all questions of balls, time,
unfair play, etc.</p>

<p>The choice of serving or receiving is decided by tossing a coin.</p>

<p>The ball is struck with the palm of either hand&mdash;one hand
only&mdash;by no other part of body, nor by both hands simultaneously.</p>

<p>The ball is dropped or bounced to the floor by the server
on that side of the service line farthest from the court. The
served ball after touching the board must cross to the far side
of the service line and land within the court. If it touches the
floor on the near side of the service line, it is short; if it touches
out of the court on the far side of the service line, it is long.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>The server may serve these balls over again, but if one “short”
and one “long;” or two “short” or two “long” balls are served
consecutively by the same player, the server (or the side, if
doubles) is out. Then the receiver becomes the server.</p>

<p>If a served ball touches the floor outside the side lines, the
server or the side is out.</p>

<p>A served ball is played on the first bounce only. A returned
ball may be played on the first bounce or on the fly. <i>All balls
served or returned must touch the board before touching the floor.</i>
A ball leaving the hand of a player striking opponent before
touching wall or floor is a “hinder.” Two hinders by one player
in a service is a put-out or a point scored. A ball leaving the
board which strikes the player who returned it, or partner, is a
put-out or a point for the side struck. A ball leaving the board
striking an opponent is a point or put-out in favor of the opposing
side of person so struck.</p>

<p>All balls are played until decided by the referee.</p>

<p>A returned ball must be within the dimensions of the court.</p>

<p>Players may block each other fairly, that is, a player may so
place the ball that he blocks his opponent, but this must be done
before the ball has left his hand. In doubles, no blocking may
be done after the ball has left the board.</p>

<p>For unfair blocking, a penalty&mdash;subtracting from one to five
points from score of the offender&mdash;may be imposed by the referee.</p>

<p>In doubles, the sides alternate in service as well as receiving.
No player shall serve or play the same defensive position all the
time.

<h2 id="Fencing">Fencing</h2>

<p>To some, the practice required to develop good form
in fencing may at first seem tedious. This practice, however,
not only rounds out the form of the fencer, but also
is very beneficial in that it exercises the muscles of the
entire body and in that it cultivates quick thinking and
stimulates mental alertness. From the physical point
of view fencing tends to develop symmetrically all the
muscles of the body, to give a lightness and quickness of
movement, gracefulness, and generally to strengthen the
body. To fence well it is necessary to think quickly
and act calmly. The fencer must judge what is best
suited for her to do. She must divine her opponent’s
attack. Thus she must be mentally alert all the
time.</p>

<p>For the beginner and inexperienced fencer, it is necessary
to have a good foil, one that is the proper weight
for the strength of the fencer. Never use a foil that is
too heavy; it is better to have a light than heavy one.
A foil must also have the proper balance. To test the
foil lay the blade across the finger about an inch below
the hilt. If the weight is properly distributed it will
balance. To avoid any accidents a fine-meshed mask
and plastron or jacket should always be worn. If a
glove is worn it should be loose enough to allow perfect
freedom of action, but not so loose as to be cumbersome.</p>

<p>Rubber-soled shoes or a shoe that will not slip should
be worn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Hold the Foil.</span></h3>

<p>The handle of the foil has two sides, the concave and
the convex. The foil is held, generally in the right hand,
so that the concave of the handle rests in the palm; the
convex is then the upper side; the fingers are closed
around the handle, the thumb rests on the upper or
convex side, without touching the hilt; the fingers
must not overlap the thumb. The foil is held correctly
when, i. e., for the right-handed fencer, the thumb nail
faces upward and the finger nails toward the left. This
position of the foil is called supination.</p>

<p>Another position is pronation. For this the back of
hand is turned up, the fingers are drawn closer together
and the thumb is closer to the fingers.</p>

<p>Form and skill count for the most in fencing, hence
strict attention is paid to the different positions until
the form is perfect. Quickness and good judgment are
acquired with practice and experience. It is of course
desirable to procure the services of a competent instructor
when a beginner.</p>

<p>The fencer should remember to use mainly the fingers
and wrist; the part played by the arms is subordinate.</p>

<p>Think quickly. Thrust and parry coolly and make
every movement count. If your movements become hurried
and flustered, the result is slashing, which is not
good fencing&mdash;good headwork counts. Try to fathom
your opponent’s methods and take advantage of every
opening she gives. Consistent practice and confidence
will enable you to be ready for any situation which
may come about.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On Guard.</span></h3>

<p>This is the elementary position in fencing. Stand at
attention, body turned facing opponent outwardly, feet
at right angles, the left foot pointing forward, the right
foot outward toward opponent.</p>

<p>1. Raise the arm holding foil lightly, extend toward
opponent, hand at height of and opposite the eye.</p>

<p>2. Drop the arm and foil, point outward, until it is
a few inches from the floor.</p>

<p>3. Sweep the foil across the body so that the foil is horizontal.
Grasp the blade close to the guard with fingers
of the left hand, palm up. The right hand is reversed.</p>

<p>4. Bend arms over head in a circle, carrying foil upward
so it is kept horizontal.</p>

<p>5. Lower right hand to height of the right breast, with
foil directed outward toward opponent at the height of
her eyes. Drop the left elbow, curving the hand over
the left shoulder.</p>

<p>6. Bend the legs, separating them at the knees.</p>

<p>7. Advance the right foot in a direct line from the
left heel to opponent. The right knee should be bent
over the right foot, both feet should be flat on the floor.</p>

<p>After these seven movements have been practised and
the position on guard reached quickly and accurately,
the fencer may take up more advanced work. The
natural instinct is to defend oneself, so a scientific
means of defense is taught. Any movement that turns
away an opponent’s foil is called a parry. As the fencing
jacket is divided into different lines of engagement, there
is a set parry for each. In all parries, it is important to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
turn the point of the opponent’s foil away from your
body. Parries are divided into two main classes, simple
and counter. The following are the simple parries:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Parry of Quarte.</span></h3>

<p>Using the fingers and wrist, the foil is carried across
body from right to left, turning the point of opponent’s
foil away from the attack; the right forearm protects
the left side, the elbow is close at side and in a line with
the hip bone; the tip of foil points up; the foil is
held in supination.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Parry of Sixte.</span></h3>

<p>The foil moves from left to right, protecting the right
side. The hand is held in supination.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Parry of Septime.</span></h3>

<p>The hand is moved as in quarte; the hand is held in
supination; the point is dropped to the waistline by a
semi-circular movement outward.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Parry of Octave.</span></h3>

<p>With the hand similar to that of septime the foil is moved
outward in a semi-circle and the point is dropped.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Parry of Quinte.</span></h3>

<p>For this, the hand from quarte is lowered toward the
hip, point upward.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Parry of Tierce.</span></h3>

<p>The foil is held in pronation. The parry of Sixte
covers the same line of engagement except in the difference
in holding the foil.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Parry of Prime.</span></h3>

<p>From quarte, the hand is moved toward the left
shoulder, the point dropped, the back of hand is turned
upward and outward.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Parry of Seconde.</span></h3>

<p>The hand is in pronation; it covers the same ground
as octave.</p>

<p>Besides these simple parries are counter parries, which
are circles described with the tip of the foil around the
opponent’s foil, holding the foil as close as possible to hers.</p>

<p>In all the parries it is practice, so that the movements
are smooth and the recovery from the parry to the on-guard
position is instantaneous. The fingers and wrist
should be used mainly in the parries, the arm movement
should be as slight as possible.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Attack.</span></h3>

<p>A fundamental of the attack first to be learned is the
thrust. The tip of the foil is aimed at the point to be
hit, the arm is straightened. Added to the thrust in the
attack is the lunge. The right foot is carried forward
(about twice its length), the left leg is straightened, the
weight of the body is on the right leg, which is bent at
the knee. The left arm is carried straight down at the
side, palm of the hand turned outward. The thrust and
the advance with the foot are simultaneous. The lunge
requires much practice to develop a quick attack and
recovery. One important factor to be remembered in
the lunge is never to get the balance too far over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
right knee. Also never let any part of the left foot leave
the floor. Immediately after the lunge and the thrust,
the fencer should quickly resume the original position,
i. e., the on guard position.</p>

<p>There are many different methods of attack, divided
into two main classes, primary and secondary. Primary
attack is one that is begun by yourself; secondary attack
is one when you attack in an opening your opponent
gives in her attack. Besides these are false attacks to
decoy the opponent’s attack.</p>

<p><i>The Direct Lunge.</i>&mdash;This is one form of attack, though
the straight attack is generally preceded by disengages.
A riposte is a thrust unaccompanied by a lunge; this is
important in secondary attack.</p>

<p><i>The Disengage.</i>&mdash;In order to attack in a center line, it
may be necessary to raise the point of your foil over or
drop it under the point of your adversary’s.</p>

<p><i>The Counter Disengage.</i>&mdash;This is a disengage (or more
than one) followed by a circling of the tip of your foil
around your opponent’s foil, followed by an attack on
your part.</p>

<p><i>The Coupe</i> (cut over).&mdash;The point of the foil is raised
by the fingers and carried down on the opposite side of
your opponent’s foil, accompanied by the lunge.</p>

<p>In the attack the fencer should remember to keep the
right arm straight, to aim at the line carefully, to always
be in a position to guard closely.</p>

<p>In a match or competitive bout, the umpire decides
the hits, but it is courtesy to acknowledge a hit yourself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<h2 id="Swimming">Swimming</h2>

<p>A graceful swimmer is as fascinating to watch as a
graceful dancer. Anyone with a thorough knowledge
of the strokes and with sufficient confidence in her own
ability may develop into a graceful and competent
swimmer. Everyone should learn to swim well, because
it is not only one of the best physical exercises, but also is
a useful accomplishment in case of emergency. Swimming
is an all-around exercise, since it brings into play
all the muscles of the body. Not only is swimming good
from the above points of view, but also as a rule it stimulates
and refreshes, and combined withal there is generally
an element of fun which lends zest to the sport.</p>

<p>Those girls who fail to enjoy their swimming do so
because they have no confidence in their ability. It is
foolhardy to venture into deep water when one cannot
swim well, but if there are good swimmers in the proximity
and a float or some other object close by which can be
reached by merely stretching out the arm, then is the
time to gain confidence and corresponding ability and
endurance.</p>

<p>Never swim in dangerous water alone. Never swim
when tired. Over-exertion in swimming, much more so
than in other sports, should be watched for, especially in
racing and long distance swims, and if any of the contestants
tire, they should leave the water.</p>

<p>There are two faults the mediocre swimmer&mdash;even the
average swimmer&mdash;is apt to have, namely, poor breathing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
and hurried strokes. It is important to learn to breathe
well. The breathing should be regular and is varied
according to the different strokes. The common tendency
is to hold the breath until it is a physical impossibility
to hold it any longer, then let it out through the
mouth with a gasp, hold the breath again, etc.</p>

<p>In haste to reach the objective point, the swimmer is
sometimes apt to hurry her stroke. Thereby she fails
to execute her strokes in good form, usually floundering
and splashing without deriving any force or impetus from
her efforts. This is not only ineffectual, but it is exceedingly
exhausting and tiring. The strokes should always
be completed in perfect form and rhythm.</p>

<p>There are varied types of strokes; often one stroke is
more suited to an individual than another. Swimming
is just as individual as walking, for it is rarely that two
people swim in identically the same manner. Often bad
habits become fixed, unconsciously, even in the strokes
of the best swimmers, so it is well to watch one’s form
carefully.</p>

<p><i>The Breast Stroke.</i>&mdash;In the breast stroke, the swimmer
is lying in the water flat upon the breast. The feet
should be but a few inches below the water; the head is
carried so that the mouth is just under the water; the
legs are together and straight, toes pointing back; the
arms are stretched straight in front, hands just touching
each other, palms down, fingers together; with elbow
stiff, the arms are circled back close under and parallel
to the surface until they are at right angles to the body;
the hands are turned in the beginning of the stroke so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
that the palms are outward; then the elbows are bent
so that they are drawn back and close to the body, and
the hands, palms down, are brought together at the chest,
ready to shoot forward to the starting position; when
the arms are drawn back the mouth is carried above the
water, then the swimmer should inhale through the
mouth; when the arms shoot forward then exhale, preferably
through the nostrils; the beginning of the kick
is made as the arms are drawn up to the chest; the legs
are drawn up, heels together, knees bent out; simultaneously
as the hands are shot forward, legs are kicked outward,
then the heels are brought quickly together.</p>

<p>In this stroke the body gets its impetus from the reach
of the arms and the kick. Thus the body should glide
through the water until the momentum is used up, then
the arms are circled back, etc. Always try to utilize
the momentum. All the parts of the stroke quickly
follow one another, so that the entire stroke is smooth.</p>

<p><i>The Side Stroke.</i>&mdash;In this stroke the kick is very important.
The scissors kick is used. The body lies with
shoulder and side flat in the water, usually the right
side; the upper leg is kept straight, almost stiff, and is
kicked forward; the under leg is bent backward from the
knee; then the legs are brought together and closed
with a snap; the arms are stretched overhead, palms
out; the upper arm, kept rigid, with the hand slightly
cupped, circles just under the surface to the thigh, then
the elbow is bent and the arm carried above the water
to the first position; the under arm starts as the upper
finishes and is carried to lower thigh; then, the elbow bent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
it is shot forward <i>under</i> the surface of the water, palm
of hand down.</p>

<p>The whole stroke is: Upper arm starts the pull, the
legs are opened, and breath is inhaled; then as the upper
arm finishes the under arm starts, the legs are snapped
together; breath is exhaled as the under arm goes forward.</p>

<p><i>The Trudgeon.</i>&mdash;The scissors kick as described in the
side stroke is used also in the trudgeon. This kick is
very important and should be practised carefully until
the swimmer is perfect.</p>

<p>It is always better to swim on the right side if it is
possible, as it relieves the pressure the heart is apt to be
subjected to if the swimmer prefers the left side. The
body rests in the water, arm stretched at full length, the
palms are turned down; the upper arm catches the
water and is brought down, the elbow is fairly stiff,
palms turned slightly outward, fingers together; when
arm is straight alongside the body, then the elbow is
bent and the arm carried forward above the water to the
first position; as the upper arm finishes, the under arm
executes the same stroke as the upper arm; the body
is rolled.</p>

<p>The whole stroke should be practised together, so that
it is smoothly and accurately done. First, the upper
arm catches the water, the body is slightly rolled, head
twisted so that breath may be inhaled during the pull,
the legs are opened at start of pull and closed at the end
of pull. Then under arm catches the water, the body is
rolled so that the face is in the water, and during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
pull the breath is exhaled slowly under the water. Then,
as under arm finishes the pull, the upper arm enters
the water, etc.</p>

<p><i>The Crawl.</i>&mdash;The crawl is the racing stroke. The best-way
to begin is first to perfect the movement of the arms.
The body is flat in the water, face down, arms slightly
bent at the elbow, stretched over head so that wrists are
a little beyond the head; the hands cut and are driven
through the water, elbows still bent, until the hands reach
the hip, then they are carried out the water and forward,
elbows in air. The arms alternate, so that while one arm
is traveling back under the water, the other is traveling
forward in the air to resume the stroke.</p>

<p>The breathing in this stroke is hard to master. As
the face is in the water, the breath is taken only every
two or three strokes by turning the head quickly as the
upper arm is being brought down; the exhaling is done
under water, while the under arm goes forward. This is
for racing; a breath may be taken at each stroke when
the stroke is slower.</p>

<p>In the kick, the legs are stiff from the hip, knees close
together, then they are moved up and down alternately
with the feet close together. It is difficult at first to maintain
the leg drive, to make the whole stroke smooth, and
to breathe easily, but these difficulties may be conquered
by practice.</p>

<p><i>Plain Back Stroke.</i>&mdash;The body is flat on the back in
the water, the arms are straight over the head, the palms
of hands upward; the palms are turned outward, then
the arms, stiff at the elbow, are circled down close to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
surface and parallel to it; after the arms are straight
by the body, they are carried to the first position, perfectly
straight, and clear of the water; the legs are
straight, then as the arms clear the water for the recovery,
they are bent as in the breast stroke kick, kicked out
straight, then the heels are brought together.</p>

<p>This stroke is almost the same as the breast stroke.</p>

<p>Another stroke is the same positions for the arms as the
plain back stroke combined with the leg drive of the
crawl.</p>

<p>Still another is the same, except that the arms move
alternately as in trudgeon stroke.</p>

<p><i>Floating.</i>&mdash;In order to float on the back, the balance of
the body must be determined; hence it is often necessary
if the feet sink to throw the head back and raise the arms
over the head. In some cases, if the legs are bent, it helps
the balance. After practice, the swimmer soon learns to
float. Short breaths, keeping the lungs as full of air
as possible, are better than long ones.</p>

<p><i>Plunge for Distance.</i>&mdash;In reality this is floating with
the face flat down in the water. The first part of the
plunge is the dive, which gives the impetus. The dive
taken is the shallow dive. As the breath is held from the
minute the head enters the water until the plunge is
finished, it is necessary that the lungs be well filled.
After the body is in the water, the muscles should be
relaxed, and the swimmer should keep the air in the
lower part of the lungs. The plunge should be as straight
as possible; the direction may be changed by moving
the arms (which are stretched straight out in front) or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the head in the direction desired. This motion should
be slight, as the least friction impedes progress, and distance
is the desired result.</p>

<h3>Diving</h3>

<p>As diving is a very large subject, it is impossible to
give in detail all the varied dives. There are three important
dives everyone should know&mdash;the front, back,
and shallow or racing dive. The beauty of diving is in
the form.</p>

<p><i>The Front Dive.</i>&mdash;The diver stands erect at the end of
the spring board, falls forward, then as the body passes
the balance point, the arms are raised straight over the
head, knees bent; then spring out so that the body is
parallel to water, arms above head; the body is curved
downward and enters the water, arms, head, body, and
legs forming a straight line.</p>

<p>In springing, jump out parallel to the water. The
running dive is very similar.</p>

<p><i>Back Dive.</i>&mdash;The diver turns with back to the water,
heels over the edge of board into space; the arms are
over head, body is curved backward; as the balance
point is reached, spring out, turning body as it enters the
water.</p>

<p>The position of the head is important. Ducking the
head or throwing it too far back, added to stiffness of
the body, makes the dive awkward. The legs should
never be apart, but together; toes pointed, so that feet
are not flat; the fingers should be together.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>The shallow dive, known as the racing dive, is important
for those interested in speed swimming, as is the
racing turn.</p>

<p><i>The Racing Dive.</i>&mdash;The swimmer stands with the body
bent forward, arms back; then, as body falls forward,
the knees are bent and the spring out is taken; the
body strikes the water arms over head, the whole body
in a straight line with the arms and legs. Do not dive
so that you sink into the water, but try to strike it at
the right angle, so that you will sink only a few inches.
The arms start the stroke as soon as they reach the surface,
then the legs commence as the arms are recovering.</p>

<p><i>The Racing Turn.</i>&mdash;The wall is touched by the arm
that the turn is to be made on. The previous strokes
must be timed so that the arm may touch the wall
stretched straight out in front. The hand touches the
wall (above the water line) palm against the wall, fingers
pointing the way the body is to turn.</p>

<p>The body is swung along the wall so that bottoms of
the feet touch the wall (a little below the water); then
with a backward stroke of the arms, which have been
brought to the hip, palms pointing in front, fingers down,
the body is brought right against the wall, nearly touching;
then the arms are forward, the legs straightened,
thus gaining impetus; the arms start the stroke, then the
legs commence as the arms start the recovery.</p>

<p>For racing, constant practice of the start, stroke and
turn is necessary. First the swimmer should perfect
her form of stroke, then the speed may be increased by
practice swims of a short distance at first, which may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
increased slowly. A swimmer should always be in good
condition. Never swim so much as to get stale; never
over-exert. It doesn’t pay in the end.</p>

<p>Choose the event you are the most proficient in and
stick to that one until you are perfect in it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Treading Water.</span></h3>

<p>It is necessary for the water polo player to know how to
tread water, that is, to remain stationary in the water
with the least effort. The body is upright in the water,
as in a standing position. The legs are moved up and
down, the arms are spread out, bent at the elbow, and
moved up and down gently. The whole movement
should be as slight as possible, so that the greatest
possible amount of rest may be obtained.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Swimming Meets.</span></h3>

<p>For swimming meets there should be a set program
of events. The contestants should be entered ahead of
time. Handicaps may be granted if the swimmers are
unevenly matched.</p>

<p>There should be a referee to conduct the meet; a
clerk of the course, who sees that the participants are
notified of the events; a scorer, who keeps an official
score; three judges, who watch for fouls; three timers,
a starter, and an announcer.</p>

<p><i>Score.</i>&mdash;The score is, as a rule, 5 for first place, 3 for
second, 1 for third. Relay races are often counted in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
different ways: 5 points, 6 points, or 8 points are the
most common for the first place.</p>

<p>The signal for the start should be: 1. “Get- on your
marks.” 2. “Get set.” 3. “Go.” (Pistol shot.) There
should be no stepping over or back from starting line.</p>

<p>Three false starts disqualify a competitor.</p>

<p>Each swimmer should keep in her own course. If she
crosses into the course of another swimmer and touches
her she is liable to disqualification.</p>

<p>In turning the swimmer should touch the end of the
pool with one or both hands.</p>

<p>The swimmer must touch the finish line with a hand
out of the water.</p>

<p>If the stroke is judged for form the competitor must
dive into the water, swim a given distance, turn, all in
perfect form.</p>

<p>In the plunge for distance the dive should be made
from a firm take-off. The body must be kept motionless,
face down, no longer than sixty seconds, however. The
distance is measured from a line parallel to the diving
base, at right angles to base, to the farthest point
reached by any part of the body.</p>

<p>A certain number of plunges, usually two or three, is
allowed to each competitor.</p>

<p>In diving there are usually a list of required and voluntary
dives. The judges consider the form with which
the dive was executed. (Form is treated under diving.)
The scale of points usually is:</p>

<p>Unsuccessful attempt, 0; Poor dive, 3; Fair dive, 6;
Good dive, 8; Excellent dive, 10.

<h3><span class="smcap">Swimming Test.</span></h3>

<p>The all-around swimming test as practised at Bryn
Mawr College in a 68-foot pool, the details of which have
been contributed by Mr. Philip Bishop, Athletic Director
of the Haverford School and Advisory Swimming Coach
at Bryn Mawr College, is given herewith.</p>

<h3>All-Around Swimming Test for Women<br />

<span class="medium smcap">By Philip Bishop.</span></h3>

<p>This test is taken in three sections: diving, plunge
and object dive in one section; form and speed in another;
endurance and underwater swim in the third.</p>

<p>Section 1.&mdash;Speed test, two lengths to be done in 44
seconds; form swimming, breast stroke, back stroke and
trudgeon, or crawl stroke.</p>

<p>Section 2.&mdash;Endurance test, 150 yards in 3 minutes;
underwater swim, 50 feet.</p>

<p>Section 3.&mdash;Diving, standing straight dive, running
straight dive, standing high dive; fancy diving, four
dives, which include jackknife, back dive and somersaults;
plunge, 30 feet; object dive, must pick up 6 rings
in 3 attempts.</p>

<p>The successful competitor must score 85 per cent to
qualify as a first-class swimmer.</p>

<p>This test is by no means a hard one, but it requires
practice. The object is to make all-around swimmers
and to teach the correct method of diving and making
the strokes employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<h2 id="Water_Basket_Ball_and_Water_Polo">Water Basket Ball and Water Polo</h2>

<p>Water basket ball and water polo are two thrilling
and interesting games. They are so similar in general
characteristics that they are treated here in the same
chapter.</p>

<p>From my own experience I believe them to be the most
strenuous games played by women. By that I do not
mean that they are necessarily harmful. I do believe,
however, that they should be played only under the most
careful supervision of a medical or physical training authority.
Two points should be considered before a girl
is permitted to participate in either of these games:</p>

<p>1. All players should be in perfect physical condition.</p>

<p>2. All players should be strong and capable swimmers.</p>

<p>3. Careful examination should be made of each player
when she comes from the tank at the end of the first
period and after the game, for that, after all, is the best
test as to whether she is fit.</p>

<p>1. To be in good condition the player should have
perfect heart action and good lung capacity, and she
should be generally in good condition.</p>

<p>2. She should be a swimmer of endurance, experience
and confidence. The beginner tires in the effort to swim
strongly and constantly.</p>

<p>3. If the player is qualified in every respect she may
try the game. If after playing she seems exhausted or
chilled, and is tired the following day, then she has not
the stamina to participate in water sports.

<h2 id="Water_Basket_Ball">Water Basket Ball</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[Reprinted from Spalding’s Athletic Library No. 361&mdash;Intercollegiate
Swimming Guide.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Water basket ball may be played in any pool, or if
played in the open should not cover more than 2,500
square feet of space. The water should be of swimming
depth, that is, the players must not be able to stand on
the bottom. There should be lines drawn “across the
bottom of the pool and up the sides 15 feet from the
ends, called 15-foot lines.”</p>

<p><i>Equipment.</i>&mdash;The necessary equipment is a regulation
water polo ball and two regulation Spalding baskets with
a firm background, 6 feet by 4, extending at least
3 feet above the top of each basket. The baskets
shall be hammock nets of cord, suspended from metal
rings 18 inches in diameter. The rings shall be 5&frac12; feet
above the water in the center of the ends of the pool.
The inside rims shall extend 6 inches from a rigid supporting
surface.</p>

<p><i>Teams.</i>&mdash;Each team consists of six players-three forwards
and three backs. Captains toss for goals.</p>

<p><i>Start.</i>&mdash;Each team lines up at its own end; the ball is
thrown into center of the pool; the forwards swim after
the ball; the backs must play back and not swim up after
ball. The forwards are the offensive players and should
be the fastest swimmers. They should also be able to
throw goals. The forwards advance the ball toward the
opponents’ basket. The center forward should feed the
two side forwards and guard the opposing center back.</p>

<p><i>Score.</i>&mdash;A goal thrown into the basket from the field
counts two points, and a free throw granted for a foul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
by opposing side counts one point. Teams line up as
in beginning after a score has been made. The backs
each guard an opposing forward and try to prevent their
scoring.</p>

<p><i>Officials.</i>&mdash;There is a referee who is in entire charge
of game, calling fouls, free throws, time out and goals.
There is a scorer, also a timer.</p>

<p><i>Time.</i>&mdash;There are two halves, not less than five minutes
nor more than eight minutes each, with five minutes
intermission. Ends are changed at the beginning of the
second half. Time is taken out for disputes, accidents,
free tries.</p>

<p><i>Out of Bounds.</i>&mdash;When the ball is sent out of bounds
by one team it is given to a player of opposing team at
place where it went out. Player must throw ball within
five seconds or it is given to opposing side.</p>

<p><i>Free Throw.</i>&mdash;A free throw is granted to a forward
upon a foul made by opposite side. The free throw is
taken from the fifteen-foot mark by one of the forwards,
who is unguarded at time of throw. If the goal is not
made, the ball is in play. If goal is made, play begins
according to start.</p>

<p><i>Fouls.</i>&mdash;The penalty for a foul is a free throw for
opposing side. There are rough fouls such as kicking,
striking, tackling, holding, deliberate splashings.</p>

<p>When an opponent has the ball she may be tackled
and “ducked” under the water by one of the opposing
players.</p>

<p>A player may not be held under water after she has
let go of ball. A player may not tackle by or hold to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
opponent’s clothing, although blocking is allowed. There
should be no holding with hands or legs. A player may
not hang on to sides when she has the ball. The ball
may not intentionally be held under water.</p>

<p><i>Tie.</i>&mdash;A tie may be played off in another three-minute
period. If game ends after foul is made, the free throw is
taken. No goal is counted after whistle has blown.</p>

<p>In both water basket ball and water polo the swimmer
should use the easiest and least tiring stroke. Whenever
there is an opportunity, a rest either by hanging on to
sides or treading water (see Swimming) ought to be taken.
Both games afford opportunity for team work in passing
and dribbling. In dribbling, the ball is kept in front of
body within easy reach for a good pass if the dribbler is
attacked.</p>

<h3>Water Polo</h3>

<p>The main factor in water polo is learning how to handle
the ball. The hand should be placed under the ball,
then the ball is lifted in the air and thrown with all the
strength of the shoulder and arm. It is ineffectual to
try to grab the ball or push it. It must be picked up.</p>

<p>The ball is tossed to the middle of the pool, then the
forwards swim up as fast as they can to get the ball.
The forwards are chosen for their speed and endurance.
Every forward should learn to shoot hard and accurately.
The center forward is usually the fastest girl on the team.
The center forward who gets the ball in the swim-up
usually tosses it back to her center-half or to one of the
side forwards. The forwards try to advance the ball,
so that a good shot for their opponents’ goal may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
obtained. If the field is clear the forward may dribble
the ball, i. e., keep the ball moving close in front of her.
Usually, however, it is better to advance the ball by
passes. One forward at least should stay close to the
goal, ready to send in any short shots.</p>

<p>The center half guards the opposing forward and feeds
the ball to her forwards. There is a guard for each of
the side forwards. It is the best policy for the guards
to stay between the forwards and the goal. Stick to
your opponent; never let her get a free shot.</p>

<p>The goal keeper must be able to reach out of the water
and catch the high balls sent into the goal. She must also
be quick. Remember, you can use both hands to handle
the ball. The guards always must help the goal keeper
cover the goal area, never leaving her unguarded, yet they
must not interfere with her or prevent her seeing clearly.</p>

<p class="caption">Volley Ball&mdash;a comparatively new game. It is splendid for growing school girls and may be played in
recess periods&mdash;exciting, exhilarating, healthful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p></div>

<p><i>Time.</i>&mdash;The duration of the match shall be 14 minutes, 7
minutes each way. Three minutes to be allowed at half time for
change of ends. When the ball crosses the goal line, whether it
be a goal, corner throw or goal throw, it shall be dead until the
restart of the game or until it leaves the hand of the player
taking the throw, and such time shall be deducted. Time occupied
by disputes and fouls, or when the ball is thrown from the
field of play or lodges on an obstruction, as per Rule for Out of
Play, shall not be reckoned as in time of play.</p>

<p><i>Officials.</i>&mdash;The officials shall consist of a referee, a timekeeper,
two goal scorers and two umpires.</p>

<p><i>Teams.</i>&mdash;Each side shall consist of seven players, two forwards,
two halves, two fullbacks and one goal keeper.</p>

<p><i>Starting.</i>&mdash;The players shall enter the water and place themselves
in a line with their respective goals. The referee shall
stand in a line with the center of the course and, having ascertained
that the captains are ready, shall give the word “Go,”
and immediately throw the ball into the water at the center. A
goal shall not be scored after starting or restarting until the ball
has been handled (viz., played with the hand below the wrist)
either by the members of one team, in which case the scorer
shall be within half-distance of the goal attacked, or by a player
of each team. The ball must be handled by more than one
player before a goal can be scored.</p>

<p><i>Scoring.</i>&mdash;A goal shall be scored by the entire ball passing
beyond the goal posts and under the cross-bar.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary Fouls.</i>&mdash;It shall be a foul:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To touch the ball with both hands at the same time.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To hold the rail or side during any part of the game, except
for rest. Goal keeper cannot interfere while holding, but can
hold all the time so long as she does not play.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To stand or touch bottom during any part of the game,
except for the purpose of resting.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To interfere with an opponent or impede her in any way
unless she is holding the ball.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) To hold the ball under water when tackled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) To jump from the bottom or push off from the side (except
at starting or restarting) in order to play the ball or “duck” an
opponent.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) To hold, pull back, or push off from an opponent.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) To turn on the back and kick at an opponent.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) To assist a player at the start or restart.</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) For the goal keeper to go more than 4 yards from her own
goal lines.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) To throw the ball at the goal keeper from a free throw.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) To refuse to play the ball at the command of the referee
after a foul or after the ball has been out of the field of play.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Dribbling or striking the ball is not holding; but lifting,
carrying, pressing under water or placing the hand under or over
the ball when actually touching, is holding. Dribbling the ball
lip through the posts is permissible.</p>

<p><i>Wilful Fouls.</i>&mdash;If, in the opinion of the referee, a player commits
an ordinary foul wilfully, the referee shall at once order
her out of the water until a goal has been scored. It shall be
considered a wilful foul to start before word “go;” to deliberately
waste time; to deliberately change position after whistle has
blown with a view to taking an advantage of an opponent; to
deliberately splash in the face of an opponent.</p>

<p><i>Free Throws.</i>&mdash;The penalty for each foul shall be a free throw
to the opposing side from the place where the foul occurred. A
goal cannot be scored from a free throw, unless the ball has been
handled (viz., played with the hand below the wrist), by at
least one other player, the goal keeper excepted.</p>

<p><i>Penalty Throws.</i>&mdash;A player wilfully fouled when within four
yards of her opponents’ goal line shall be awarded a penalty
throw, and the player who commits the offense must be ordered
out of the water until a goal has been scored. The penalty
throw shall be taken from any point on the four-yard line. In
the case of a penalty throw it shall not be necessary for the ball
to be handled by any other player before the goal can be scored,
but any player within the four-yard line may intercept a penalty
throw.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;A player ordered out of the water for committing a
wilful foul must remain out until a goal has been scored, notwithstanding
that half-time may intervene or extra time be
played, except by permission of the referee.</p>

<p><i>Declaring Fouls.</i>&mdash;The referee or umpires shall declare a foul
by blowing a whistle. The player nearest to where the foul
occurred shall take the throw. The other players shall remain
in their respective positions from the blowing of the whistle
until the ball has left the hand of the player taking the throw.
In the event of one or more players from each team committing
a foul so nearly at the same moment as to make it impossible for
the referee to distinguish who offended first, she shall have the
ball out of the water and throw it in as nearly as possible at the
place where the foul occurred in such a manner that one member
of each team may have equal chance of playing the ball. In
such cases the ball must be allowed to touch the water before it
is handled and must be handled (i. e., played with the hand below
the wrist) by more than one player before a goal can be scored.</p>

<p><i>Goal Keeper.</i>&mdash;The goal keeper may stand to defend her goal,
and must not throw the ball beyond half distance; the penalty
for doing so shall be a free throw to the opposing side from half
distance at either side of the field of play. She must keep within
four yards of her own goal line or concede a free throw from the
four-yard line to her nearest opponent. The goal keeper is
exempt from clauses <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>f</i> in Rule for Ordinary Fouls, but
she may be treated as any other player when in possession of the
ball. Except when injury or illness compel her to leave the water,
the goal keeper can only be changed at half time.</p>

<p><i>Goal Line Corner Throws.</i>&mdash;A player throwing the ball over
her own goal line shall concede a free corner throw to her opponents,
and such free corner throw shall be taken by the player of
the opposing side nearest the point where the ball leaves the
field of play; if the attacking side throw the ball over, it shall be
a free goal throw to their opponents’ goal keeper.</p>

<p><i>Out of Play.</i>&mdash;Should a player send the ball out of the field
of play at either side, it shall be thrown in any direction from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
where it went out by one of the opposing side, and shall be considered
a free throw. The player nearest the point where the
ball leaves the field of play must take the throw. Should a ball
strike an overhead obstruction and rebound into the field of play,
it shall be considered in play; but if it lodges on or in an overhead
obstruction, it shall be considered out of play, and the referee
shall then stop the game and throw the ball into the water
under the obstruction on or in which it had lodged.</p>

<p><i>Declaring Goals, Time, etc.</i>&mdash;The referee shall declare fouls,
half-time and time by whistle; the timekeeper may notify half-time
and time by whistle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<h2 id="Volley_Ball">Volley Ball</h2>

<p>Volley ball is another team game which is rapidly
becoming popular among girls. It may be played indoors
or outdoors and can be enjoyed by large groups
of girls. The game is a combination of tennis and
hand ball and consists of keeping a ball in motion over
a high net.</p>

<p>Many girls, particularly the young and those who are
weakly, are compelled to refrain from indulging in many
of our most popular games. These can play volley ball
without running the risk of any serious injury. There
is no bodily contact with opponents. The ball is soft
and does not injure the one hitting it or anyone who
may accidentally be hit with it.</p>

<p>The space, ball and net usually can be acquired with
little difficulty, and the ball and net are very inexpensive
when we consider how long they last and the
number of games which can be enjoyed by a great many
persons before they have to be repaired or replaced.</p>

<p>While the rules call for a definite size of court, it
should be remembered that a good game can be played
and lots of fun enjoyed in school rooms and other places
that may be available, where the space and other
requirements are less than those specified.</p>

<p>The rules for the game are revised annually by a
joint committee of the Young Men’s Christian Association
and the National Collegiate Athletic Association
and are published in Spalding’s Athletic Library.

<span class="large smcap">By Josephine Katzenstein.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[The Philadelphia Hockey League has been successfully
organized as is told by Miss Josephine Katzenstein, a member
of the Lansdowne hockey team. Miss Katzenstein has been
chosen for the All-Philadelphia team every year since its start.
Previous to this, she played on the Bryn Mawr ’varsity. It is
needless to say that she is one of the best forwards that ever
played in the Philadelphia League.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p></blockquote>

<p>When we consider that before 1901 field hockey for
women was hardly more than a name in and around
Philadelphia, and that since that year enthusiasm for
the game has so steadily grown that we have now perhaps
the finest hockey league in the country, we may justly
feel optimistic on the subject of athletics for women.</p>

<p>In 1907, there were eight hockey clubs in this vicinity&mdash;enough
to organize an inter-club hockey league. Merion
Cricket Club, Belmont Cricket Club, Lansdowne Country
Club, Germantown Hockey Club, Philadelphia Cricket
Club, Moorestown Field Club, Haddonfield Hockey
Club, and Frankford Cricket Club composed the league.
Later Belmont went out of existence, Frankford and
Moorestown withdrew, and Temple College joined the
league. Now Lansdowne, Germantown, Haddonfield,
Philadelphia and Merion have second teams, while Riverton
plays only in the second league.</p>

<p>The different teams must have distinguishing colors,
and no club joining the league may use the colors already
adopted by another club. So far Temple is the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
club far-sighted enough to play in bloomers instead of in
hampering skirts. It is hoped by many that all may soon
follow her wise example. Professionals are barred from
competition on any league team. A team may be admitted
to the league upon application to and approval
by the Executive Committee. Each team has to play
two matches with every other club in the league&mdash;one on
the home field and one on the opponent’s.</p>

<p>Since 1908 a committee formed of a representative
from each club has chosen an All-Philadelphia team to
play outside teams, after the inter-club games are over.
This has proved an incentive to consistently good playing
all season, as one knows that the critics’ eyes are on
one in every game. It has also helped to spread the
interest in hockey.</p>

<p>Bryn Mawr, New York, Baltimore and Rosemary Hall
(Greenwich, Conn.) teams have been met repeatedly by
the All-Philadelphia team.

<span class="large"><span class="smcap">By Miss Lorena L. Parrish</span>,</span><br />

<small>Physical Director Howard Payne College.</small></h2>

<p>It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to give
you a glimpse of the work of the Junior Colleges of
Missouri in Athletics.</p>

<p>In 1914, the organization known as the Junior College
Athletic Association of Missouri was formed. Up until
this time there were only a few of the colleges devoting
much time to athletics. Howard Payne has for years been
one of the strongest supporters of athletics for women,
not only within her own college, but a strong advocate
of intercollegiate sports. Since the organization there
have been four out of the seven junior colleges which have
taken up active intercollegiate basket ball-Christian
College and Stephens College, both of Columbia, Mo.,
Lindenwood of St. Charles and Howard Payne of
Fayette. I feel confident that in another year the remaining
three will join our ranks. We also have our
tennis tournaments every spring.</p>

<p>In the year 1915, we started for the first time work
in track and field athletics. A dual meet was held here
on May 17 between Howard Payne and Stephens. It
met with such overwhelming success that we have
planned to make it an annual event. There were several
physicians present at the meet, and they were very
enthusiastic in their praise of the work, saying that it
was one of the finest moves that had been made within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
recent years for the development of our girls. Notwithstanding
these facts, there is still a great deal of prejudice
against this particular form of athletics, and the two
questions that are uppermost in the minds of a great
many are: “Are we taking chances with the girls’ future
health by allowing these sports?” “Do the advantages
gained overshadow the possible danger?” These questions
should be given careful consideration by the physical
directors and they should see to it that the girls under
their charge receive careful training and supervision.
It is only in this way that we shall be able to break down
the prevailing prejudices. I should say that under proper
conditions and supervision the gain in health and strength
far outweighs the risks of danger. Here in our own school
the girls who are most active in athletics are the healthiest
and are rarely ever absent from classes because of illness.</p>

<p>Since the meet held here in Fayette in 1915 was the
first intercollegiate meet of its kind for girls in this section
of the country, it might be of interest to include
in this article the various events used:</p>

<p class="table">

<h2 id="Girls_Branch_of_the_Public_Schools">Girls’ Branch of the Public Schools
Athletic League</h2>

<p>Among the sanctioned activities of the Girls’ Branch of
the Public Schools Athletic League are the following team
games for the Elementary Schools: End Ball, Captain
Ball, Basket Ball, Punch Ball, Indoor Base Ball.</p>

<p><i>End Ball</i> can be played by a varied number of players.
The playing rules are to be found in the Official Handbook
of the Girls’ Branch of the Public Schools Athletic
League, published by the American Sports Publishing
Company. This book says: “The object of the game is for
the guards on one side to throw the ball over the heads
of the guards on the opposite side to their own basemen,
at the end of the opposite field. Each such ball caught
by a baseman shall score one point for the side
catching it.</p>

<p>“The object of the intervening guards is to intercept
the ball before it can reach the basemen at their rear,
and to throw it in turn to their own basemen at the rear
of the opposite court, over the heads of the intervening
opponents.”</p>

<p><i>Captain Ball.</i>&mdash;“The main object of the game is for
the basemen of a team to pass the ball from one to
another, each pass successfully made scoring for the
team, as described under ‘Score.’</p>

<p>“The object of the guards is to intercept the passage
of the ball and send it back to their own basemen for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
similar play.” For the rules and details see Official Handbook
of the League.</p>

<p><i>Basket Ball.</i>&mdash;The Spalding Athletic Library rules for
the line game are used.</p>

<p><i>Punch Ball.</i>&mdash;For this the league rules as set forth in
Official Handbook. “The object of the batter is to hit
the ball into the field in such a way that it may not be
caught by the fielders, and to run to first base. The
object of the fielders is to return the ball to their catcher,
who shall stand on the home plate and hold the ball
before the batter reaches first base. If the fielders muff
the ball and are slow in returning it to home plate, the
batter who has reached first may continue on to second
or third base, or as far as in her judgement she can get
before the ball reaches home plate. The player running
the bases may always advance a base whenever the
opportunity occurs and the ball is in play. The final
object of the player running to the bases is to touch each
base and to reach the home plate without being put
out, thus scoring one run for her side.”</p>

<p>Besides these team games, the league sanctions the
following activities, which are conducted according to
rules and regulations set forth in the Official Handbook:
Folk Dancing, Walking, Swimming, Horseback Riding,
Ice and Roller Skating, Rope Skipping, Bicycling, Coasting,
Golf, Lawn Tennis, Hand Tennis, Heavy Gymnastics,
Track and Field Events, Field Hockey, Volley Ball,
Newcomb and Pin Ball.

<h2 id="Intercollegiate_Alumnae_Athletic">Intercollegiate Alumnae Athletic
Association<br />

<span class="smcap large">By Miss Lillian Schoedler</span>,<br />

<span class="small">Originator and Honorary President of the Intercollegiate A. A. A.;
Chairman of the Alumnae Committee on Athletics
of Barnard College.</span></h2>

<p>New York witnessed the establishment of the first
Intercollegiate Alumnæ Athletic Association the world
has known. And its organization proves beyond a
doubt the strong grip that athletics are getting on the
modern woman.</p>

<p>In 1913 a group of twenty-five alumnæ from Barnard
College, which met for swimming and basket ball, sowed
the seed for the present association. That seed grew so
quickly that by 1916 there had been 974 enrollments for
the athletic work which the Alumnae Committee on
Athletics of Barnard College had originated, and the
activities had grown until they included, besides basket
ball and swimming, social, folk and æsthetic dancing,
bowling, hand ball, gymnasium work, indoor and outdoor
horseback riding, with drill work, polo and basket ball on
horseback, field hockey, base ball, tennis, tramping, summer
boat and trolley trips, swimming parties, and college
picnics of all kinds.</p>

<p>Three factors have contributed to the success of the
alumnæ athletic movement in New York. In the first
place, its activities have been carried on outside of business
hours&mdash;in evenings, or during week-ends&mdash;so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
college women who work, as well as their more leisurely
sisters, could enjoy the fun. In the second place, the
social end as well as the athletic has been provided for in
the making of all plans, and as a result alumnæ athletics,
through their informality and atmosphere of “camaraderie,”
are serving to bring together college individuals
and groups as nothing else can. And, in the third place,
everything has been planned as simply and inexpensively
as possible, as witness the fact that horses are secured at
one of the best New York academies for sixty-three cents
an hour, including instruction, and that members who
have no habits ride in middy blouses and bloomers.
There is no pretense at “style,” but every emphasis on
fun.</p>

<p>The new association is a pioneer in its field, and is being
watched with much interest by college men and women
alike. It is hoped that before long similar associations
will spring up in various sections of the country, and that
college women will soon have the organized facilities for
exercise and recreation for the possession of which they
have always envied their college brothers.</p>

<p>Which city will be the first to follow New York’s
successful example?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Schoedler has very kindly consented to give advice
to any group of college women in any city who wish
to form an organization for the purpose of continuing
athletics. Communications to Miss Schoedler at 249
West 107th Street, New York City, will result in a prompt
answer.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Editor.</span>

<h2 id="Standard_Quality">Standard Quality</h2>

<p>An article that is universally given the appellation “<b>Standard</b>” is thereby
conceded to be the criterion, to which are compared all other things of a similar
nature. For instance, the Gold Dollar of the United States is the Standard unit
of currency, because it must legally contain a specific proportion of pure gold
and the fact of its being Genuine is guaranteed by the Government Stamp
thereon. As a protection to the users of this currency against counterfeiting and
other tricks, considerable money is expended in maintaining a Secret Service
Bureau of Experts. Under the law, citizen manufacturers must depend to a
great extent upon Trade-Marks and similar devices to protect themselves against
counterfeit products&mdash;without the aid of “Government Detectives” or “Public
Opinion” to assist them.</p>

<p>Consequently the “Consumer’s Protection” against misrepresentation and
“inferior quality” rests entirely upon the integrity and responsibility of the
“Manufacturer.”</p>

<p>A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros. have, by their rigorous attention to “Quality,” for
forty years, caused their Trade-Mark to become known throughout the
world as a Guarantee of Quality as dependable in their field as the U. S.
Currency is in its field.</p>

<p>The necessity of upholding the Guarantee of the Spalding Trade-Mark and
maintaining the Standard Quality of their Athletic Goods, is therefore, as obvious
as is the necessity of the Government in maintaining a Standard Currency.</p>

<p>Thus each consumer is not only insuring himself but also protecting other
consumers when he assists a Reliable Manufacturer in upholding his Trade-Mark
and all that it stands for. Therefore, we urge all users of our Athletic
Goods to assist us in maintaining the Spalding Standard of Excellence, by
insisting that our Trade-Mark be plainly stamped on all athletic goods which
they buy, because without this precaution our best efforts towards maintaining
Standard Quality and preventing fraudulent substitution will be ineffectual.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of Standard Articles invariably suffer the reputation of being
high-priced, and this sentiment is fostered and emphasized by makers of
“inferior goods,” with whom low prices are the main consideration.</p>

<p>A manufacturer of recognized Standard Goods, with a reputation to uphold
and a guarantee to protect must necessarily have higher prices than a manufacturer
of cheap goods, whose idea of and basis of a claim for Standard Quality
depends principally upon the eloquence of the salesman.</p>

<p>We know from experience that there is no quicksand more unstable than
poverty in quality&mdash;and we avoid this quicksand by Standard Quality.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
